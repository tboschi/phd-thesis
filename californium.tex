\chapter{Neutron calibration with a californium source}


\tapi{252}Cf decays through $\alpha$-emission (~97\%) %
and SF (~3\%) with a half-life of 2.65\,y.
SF emits many neutrons (3.7 per fission) and gammas.
AmBe source, \tapi{241}Am decays through %
$\alpha$-emission with a half-life of 432.6\,y.
The $\alpha$ is captured by \tapi{9}Be, %
followed by emission of a neutron and %
de-excitement of \tapi{12}C\tapi{*} with 4.4\,MeV photon.
\tapi{252}Cf very intense neutron source
SNO collaboration developed \emph{Time Series Analysis} method
that uses multiplicity and time intervals between the detected events %
to find the neutron detection efficiency, the neutron mean life inside the detector, and activity from non-fission events.
Two scenarios:
some successive short intervals of a few milliseconds from a single SF
some long intervals of $\sim1$\,s that could be pairs of SF, %
independent background or some non fission decays from the source.
