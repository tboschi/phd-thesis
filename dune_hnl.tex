\chapter{HNL searches at DUNE}

Heavy nearly-sterile neutrinos are a common ingredient in extensions of the
Standard Model which aim to explain neutrino masses, like for instance in Type I
seesaw models, or one of its variants. If the scale of the new Heavy Neutral Leptons (HNLs) is sufficiently low, 
observable signatures can arise in a range of current and upcoming experiments, from the LHC to neutrino experiments.
%
In this article, we discuss the phenomenology of sterile neutrinos in the MeV to GeV mass range, focusing on their decays. We embed our discussion in a realistic mass model and consider the resulting implications.
%
We focus in particular on the impact on the signal of the strong polarisation
effects in the beam for Majorana and \mbox{(pseudo-)Dirac} states, providing formulae 
to incorporate these in both production and decay.
%
We study how the Near Detector of the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino
Experiment can constrain HNL states by searching for their decay products inside the detector.
%
We conduct a Monte Carlo background analysis for the most promising
signatures, incorporating the detector's particle identification capabilities,
and estimate the experimental sensitivity of DUNE to these particles.  
%
We also present an estimate of the \mbox{$\nu_\tau$-derived} HNL flux at DUNE, 
currently missing in the literature, which allows us to discuss searches for 
HNLs at higher masses.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The evidence for three neutrino flavour oscillation is well established~\cite{Fukuda:1998mi,Aharmim:2005gt} %
and can be accounted for only if neutrino mass splittings are non zero~\cite{nufit}.
This implies that neutrinos are massive and mix, forcing to consider extensions %
of the Standard Model (SM) to explain their origin. 
A simple means of doing so is to introduce the right-handed counterpart of SM neutrinos, which are %
singlet with respect to all SM gauge symmetries.
The Lagrangian includes a Yukawa coupling between these sterile states, the Higgs boson and the leptonic doublet, %
which generates Dirac mass-terms below the scale of Electroweak Symmetry Breaking (EWSB), 
and Majorana mass terms for the new singlet states.
On diagonalisation of the resulting neutrino mass matrix, the heavy neutrino states, %
commonly known as nearly-sterile neutrinos or Heavy Neutral Leptons (HNLs) in experimental contexts, %
remain mainly in the sterile neutrino direction and have sub-weak interactions suppressed by %
elements of the extended Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) mixing matrix. 

These states have been connected to a vast range of phenomenological behaviours and %
even to cosmological implications (for a recent review on sterile neutrinos, see \eg \refref{Abazajian:2012ys}).
For instance, nearly-sterile neutrinos in the keV region are viable warm Dark Matter candidates (see \eg \refref{Asaka:2005an}), %
whereas heavier HNLs could play a role in leptogenesis~\cite{Fukugita:1986hr, Covi:1996wh, Pilaftsis:1997jf, Buchmuller:1997yu, %
Pilaftsis:2003gt, Davidson:2008bu, Akhmedov:1998qx, Asaka:2005pn, Hernandez:2015wna, Hernandez:2016kel, %
Hambye:2016sby, Hambye:2017elz, Drewes:2017zyw}.
So far, some possible hints in favour of heavy neutrinos have emerged in neutrino appearance oscillation experiments, %
specifically LSND~\cite{Aguilar:2001ty} and MiniBooNE~\cite{Aguilar-Arevalo:2012fmn, Aguilar-Arevalo:2013pmq, Aguilar-Arevalo:2018gpe} %
but are disfavoured by disappearance experiments~\cite{TheIceCube:2016oqi, Adamson:2017uda, Aartsen:2017bap}, %
unless non-standard effects are present~\cite{Liao:2016reh, Liao:2018mbg, Esmaili:2018qzu, Denton:2018dqq}. Further hints 
in the same mass range have been reported for mixing with electron neutrinos in the so-called reactor anomaly~\cite{Mueller:2011nm, Mention:2011rk, Huber:2011wv, Ko:2016owz, Alekseev:2018efk} and in the less statistically significant Gallium one~\cite{Abdurashitov:2005tb, Laveder:2007zz, Giunti:2006bj}.
Explanations of the MiniBooNE low energy excess invoking GeV-scale HNLs with non-standard interactions~\cite{Gninenko:2009ks, Gninenko:2010pr, %
	Masip:2012ke, Bertuzzo:2018itn, Ballett:2018ynz}, %
have also been put forward. In these models, heavy neutral fermions are produced by neutrino up-scattering in the detector and subsequently decaying into photons or electrons, which mimic an electron neutrino interaction.
The interpretation of the current experimental results is still largely debated in the scientific community.
Searches both for electron-like signatures in MicroBooNE, the SBN programme at Fermilab~\cite{Antonello:2015lea}, %
and in short baseline reactor neutrino experiments, such as DANNS~\cite{Alekseev:2018efk}, NEOS~\cite{Ko:2016owz}, %
PROSPECT~\cite{Ashenfelter:2018iov}, STEREO~\cite{Almazan:2018wln}, NEUTRINO-4~\cite{Serebrov:2018vdw}, %
will shed further light on these possibilities.

Apart from these controversial hints, no positive evidence of heavy neutrinos has been found to date in laboratory searches.
A thorough review of the current constraints can be found in~\refrefs{Atre:2009rg, Drewes:2015iva}. 
%
%
%
%and studies of
%$0\nu\beta\beta$~\cite{Benes:2005hn} 
%
Bounds critically depend on the HNL masses and the flavour with which they mix.
Searches for kinks in Curie plots of $\beta$-decay
spectra~\cite{Galeazzi:2001py, Hiddemann:1995ce, Holzschuh:1999vy,
	Holzschuh:2000nj, Deutsch:1990ut} have placed bounds on the electronic
mixing for HNL masses between the keV and MeV scales.  
%
For masses from a few MeV to a few hundreds MeV, searches for monochromatic peaks in the lepton spectrum of decaying pions %
and kaons place important bounds on the muonic and electronic mixing angles~\cite{Artamonov:2014urb, Britton:1992pg, Britton:1992xv, Aguilar-Arevalo:2017vlf, Aguilar-Arevalo:2019owf}.
Neutrinoless double beta decay indirectly constrains Majorana HNLs from the eV to the TeV scale %
and lepton number violating meson and tau decays can be used to set limits on the mixing angle %
in narrow ranges of HNLs masses~\cite{Atre:2009rg}. 
%
%
The tightest constraints come from searches for the direct production and subsequent decays of heavy neutrinos %
in \emph{beam dump} experiments and at colliders.
%
The strongest limits were set by the PS191 experiment~\cite{Bernardi:1985ny, Bernardi:1987ek}, %
a beam dump experiment which ran at CERN in 1984.
Its most stringent upper bounds on the novel mixing angles are \mbox{$|U_{e4}|^2, |U_{\mu4}|^2 \leq \np{e-8} \text{\,--\,} \np{e-9}$} %
for neutrino masses between the pion and the kaon mass.
Other bounds of this type can be found in~\refrefs{Abreu:1996pa, Adriani:1992pq, Vilain:1994vg, Vaitaitis:1999wq, Badier:1985wg, CooperSarkar:1985nh, Gallas:1994xp}
as well as collider ones, from LHCb~\cite{Aaij:2014aba}, ATLAS~\cite{Aaboud:2018spl}, CMS~\cite{Sirunyan:2018mtv, Sirunyan:2018xiv}, BELLE~\cite{Liventsev:2013zz} %
(see also \refref{Harrison:2015bja}).

% Similarly, peak searches in leptonic decays
%at rest of pions and kaons have proved to be a very powerful probe of the
%mixing of heavy neutrinos with both $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu$.  If a heavy
%neutrino is produced in such decays, the lepton spectrum would show a
%monochromatic line at % \begin{equation} % E_\ell = \frac{M_0^2 + m_\ell^2 -
%m_N^2}{2 M_0} % \end{equation} % where $M_0$ is the decaying meson mass and
%$m_\ell$ the associated lepton.  Different experiments
%{E949~\cite{Artamonov:2014urb}, PIENU~\cite{PIENU:2011aa},
%TRIUMF~\cite{Britton:1992pg}~\cite{Britton:1992xv}} studied $\pi$ and $K$
%decays placing robust bounds.  % Searches for kinks in Curie plots of
%$\beta$-decay spectra~\cite{Galeazzi:2001py, Hiddemann:1995ce,
%Holzschuh:1999vy, Holzschuh:2000nj, Deutsch:1990ut} and studies of
%$0\nu\beta\beta$~\cite{Benes:2005hn} have placed bounds on the electronic
%mixing.  % A thorough review of the current constraints is found
%in~\cite{Atre:2009rg, Drewes:2015iva}.
%

It is exciting to note that current and upcoming neutrino oscillation
experiments will be able to perform beam dump style measurements \cite{Kusenko:2004qc, Asaka:2012bb, Abe:2019kgx}. 
%
A crucial difference between oscillation detectors and dedicated beam dump searches of the past is that %
the former tries to maximise its Standard Model neutrino scattering rate, while the latter goes to lengths %
to suppress it in order to reduce backgrounds.
%
However, for some of the current and future accelerator neutrino experiments, %
such as the Short Baseline Neutrino (SBN) program~\cite{Antonello:2015lea}, %
the strong particle reconstruction capabilities of Liquid Argon detectors and distinctive kinematics %
of neutrino decays have been shown to allow competitive bounds on heavy neutrinos %
to be made despite naively large backgrounds \cite{Ballett:2016opr}. 
%
Long baseline oscillation experiments, such as the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE)~\cite{Abi:2018dnh}, %
will see a greatly diluted flux of nearly-sterile neutrinos at their far detectors and consequently poor sensitivity.
However, the DUNE Near Detector (DUNE ND), placed \np{574}\,m from the target, has a great potential %
for searches for new physics~\cite{Adams:2013qkq}.
Even if the final design of the ND has not been confirmed as yet, the options being considered combine a large active volume, %
in close proximity to a very intense neutrino beam and cutting-edge event reconstruction capabilities.
These will allow DUNE ND to undertake valuable searches for BSM physics in a entirely complementary way %
to the central oscillation physics programme. 

In this article, we present a detailed analysis of the sensitivity of DUNE ND to HNL in beam dump style searches.
Differently from previous sensitivity studies \cite{Krasnov:2019kdc, Adams:2013qkq},  %
we ground our discussion in theoretically consistent models, in which sterile neutrinos are associated with neutrino %
mass generation via a low-scale seesaw mechanism. %, such as inverse seesaw (ISS) mechanisms.
We note that the range of masses and mixing angles testable at DUNE~ND is of interest for the generation of %
the baryon asymmetry in the context of the ASR mechanism~\cite{Akhmedov:1998qx, Asaka:2005pn, Hernandez:2015wna, Hernandez:2016kel, Drewes:2017zyw}.
We consider both Majorana and pseudo-Dirac states and calculate their decay and production rates, 
with careful consideration given to helicity arguments.
These formulae are then used to estimate the sensitivity of the experiment, %
taking into account the beam and detector performance capabilities thanks to simulations of both event and background signals.
We stress that DUNE will be able to extend the current limits on new fermionic singlets, %
including those with masses above 500\,MeV, probing models of theoretical significance for the generation of neutrino mass.
We show that bounds can be put also on the mixing with tau neutrinos, thanks to the high energy~beam.
%Ultimately, we show that DUNE will mostly (but not exclusively) be sensitive to pseudo-Dirac states.
%and this can have consequence for the signal and analysis strategies adopted by the collaboration.
%Also by considering the relationship between low-scale steriles and neutrino masses, %
%our predictions from DUNE can be correlated with constraints from other experiments such as searches for LNV and NSIs/non-unitarity. 
%

\section{Heavy neutrinos in seesaw models}
\label{sec:model}

The lightness of the observed neutrino masses can be explained in a range of different scenarios. %
New SM-gauge singlet fermions are a feature common to many of them. 
The~most general Lagrangian  including a set of right-chiral gauge singlets 
$\{{\cal{N}}_i\}$ is given by 
%
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:model}
	\mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}+\mathcal{N}} = \mathcal{L}_\text{SM} + i\, \cj{\mathcal{N}}_i \sh{\pd} \mathcal{N}_i + Y_{\alpha i} \cj{L}_\alpha \widetilde{H} \mathcal{N}_i + \frac{1}{2} (M_R)_{ij} \cj{\mathcal{N}^c}_i \mathcal{N}_j + \text{h.c.}\ ,
	%\mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}+N} = \mathcal{L}_\text{SM} + i \cj{N}_i \sh{\pd} N_i + Y_{\alpha i} \cj{L}_\alpha \tilde{H} N_i %
	%+ \frac{1}{2} (M_R)_{ij} \cj{N^c}_i N_j + \text{h.c.}\ ,
\end{equation}
%
with $\mathcal{L}_\text{SM}$ denoting the SM Lagrangian and the other symbols taking their conventional meaning.
Without loss of generality, $M_R$ can be chosen to be diagonal.
After electroweak symmetry breaking, a Dirac mass emerges for which we will use the notation $m_D \equiv v Y/\sqrt{2}$.
%
This term appears, for instance, in the famous Type I seesaw mechanism~\cite{Minkowski:1977sc,Mohapatra:1979ia,GellMann:1980vs,Yanagida:1979as}. %
Majorana masses for the light neutrinos arise and are given by
%
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:typeI}
	m_\nu = -m_D M_R^{-1} m_D^T + \mathcal{O}\qty(\qty[m_D M_R^{-1}]^2)\ .
\end{equation}
%
The heavy neutrino masses are approximately given by the diagonal entries of $M_R$ and its corresponding eigenstates, %
the heavy nearly-sterile neutrinos $N_i$, have suppressed mixing with active neutrinos and are mainly composed %
by sterile fields.
Neglecting the matrix nature of these expressions for now, if $m_D$ takes values around the electroweak scale, %
acceptable neutrino masses are produced when $M_R$ has values around the GUT scale, %
suggestively connecting it to a high-scale breaking of $U(1)_{B-L}$~\cite{Minkowski:1977sc}.
Low-scale solutions are also possible by taking the Yukawa couplings to be similar %
or smaller than the other SM lepton Yukawa couplings, \eg if $m_D$ takes values in the keV range, %
new nearly-sterile states would exist with masses around a GeV.
%
Although the mass scale for the heavy neutrino can span many orders of magnitude, %
the resulting mixing is constrained by the contribution given to light neutrino masses
%
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:TypeI_mixing_bound}
	\qty|U_{\alpha N}|^2 \lesssim \frac{m_\nu}{m_N} \lesssim  \np{e-10}\ \frac{1\,\mathrm{GeV}}{m_N}\ ,
	%
\end{equation}
%
where we have taken $m_\nu\lesssim 0.1$\,eV.
These suppressed mixing angles make experimental searches for heavy neutrinos in this range particularly challenging, %
and beyond the capabilities of most experiments to-date.

In recent years a lot of interest has focused on more complex models with multiple new fermion states, %
\eg the Inverse Seesaw~(ISS)~\cite{Mohapatra:1986bd, GonzalezGarcia:1988rw}, extended seesaw~\cite{Barr:2003nn} %
and linear seesaw models~\cite{Malinsky:2005bi,Kang:2006sn}.
%
In these cases the bound in Eq.~(\ref{eq:TypeI_mixing_bound}) can be avoided because of the cancellation between %
the contributions to neutrino masses by a different sterile neutrino.
For~definiteness, we will focus on the ISS model.
In this case, a quasi-preserved lepton number guarantees the specific texture of $M_R$ and $m_D$ %
and its small breaking is natural in the 't Hooft sense~\cite{tHooft:1980xss}.
%We will refer to such models as ``symmetry-protected''.

The physical spectrum of heavy neutrinos can be best understood in the Lepton Number Conserving (LNC) limit.
We use ISS\,$(a,b)$ to denote the model with $a$ $(b)$, $a,b\neq 0$, new gauge singlets of lepton number $+1$ $(-1)$.
Following \refeq{eq:model} and \refeq{eq:typeI}, the most general mass matrices are then given by 
%
\[
	m_D = \qty( \begin{matrix} m, 0\end{matrix}) \qquad \text{and}\qquad M_R = %
	\qty(\begin{matrix} 0 & M^\text{T} \\ M & 0 \end{matrix})\ ,
\]
%
where we introduce the $3\times a$ complex matrix $m$ and the $b\times a$ complex matrix $M$.
%
The spectrum of physical states in the LNC limit for ISS\,$(a,b)$ is given by
%
\[	
	%
	\text{min}\{3+b,a\}~\text{Dirac pairs}\qquad\text{and}\qquad
	|3 + b-a|~\text{massless Weyl states}.  
	%
\] 
%
The masses of the Dirac pairs are the non-zero singular values of the rectangular $a \times (3+b)$ matrix $(m^\text{T}, M^\text{T})$.
Note that for $a\neq b$, in addition to a set of Dirac pairs of arbitrary masses, extra massless sterile states %
degenerate with the light neutrinos are present.
Mixing involving these degenerate states is not defined in the LNC limit, as any unitary map in the degenerate subspace is permissible.
On the contrary, the introduction of a small Lepton Number Violating (LNV) parameter %
perturbs the LNC spectrum as well as the mixing.
In general there are only two possible origins for a low-scale heavy neutrino: 
%
 \begin{itemize}
			%
		\item A massless Weyl fermion in the LNC limit which is given non-zero mass proportional to the perturbation.
			As the mixing between massless states is not defined in the LNC limit, the perturbation controls %
			the induced mixing between the nearly-sterile state and the active ones.
			We will refer to this state as a Majorana neutrino.
			%
		\item A massive Dirac pair at the low scale in the LNC limit, becoming a pseudo-Dirac pair after the perturbation, %
			which regulates the mass splitting of the pair.
			In the LNC limit, the mixing angles between Dirac pair and light neutrinos can be arbitrarily large,
			and this property remains after the perturbation.
			%
	\end{itemize}
	%
	The first case only arises in models with an imbalanced number of new fields, %
	\ie ISS\,$(a,b)$ such that $a\neq b$, while the second option can occur in any ISS model. 

In this paper, we are interested in heavy states with masses in the MeV--GeV range.%
\footnote{This is motivated by the kinematic limits on production from meson decays discussed in more detail in \refsec{sec:production}.} %
Our discussion above suggests that both Majorana states and (pseudo-)Dirac states should be considered, %
covering all possible phenomenological aspects.
In what follows, we will compute the production and decay rates for Majorana states %
and Dirac states and study their discovery potential at DUNE ND.
We disregard lepton number violating effects and therefore the distinction between pseudo-Dirac and Dirac states will not be relevant.

Feynman rules for Majorana states derived from \refeq{eq:model} can be found in~\cite{Atre:2009rg},
or constructed using the techniques of \refref{Denner:1992me}. 
For an explicit comparison between Dirac versus Majorana Feynman rules for heavy neutrinos, see~\refref{Abada:2016plb}.



\section{Heavy neutrino decay}
\label{sec:decay}

In this section we compute the heavy neutrino decay rates and polarised %
distributions necessary for the simulation of beam dump searches.
We compute rates for both Majorana and (pseudo-)Dirac states, allowing us to consistently %
explore the parameter space of low-scale seesaw models.
%
%If the new neutrinos are massive enough, their mass-splittings with the light
%neutrinos could be larger than the wave packet energy-uncertainty associated
%with the production mechanism and they no longer
%oscillate~(see \eg\ \refref{Akhmedov:2009rb}). Instead, the neutrinos are stable enough to
%propagate to a short-baseline detector and decay into visible SM particles.
%%
%In this section we discuss the decay rates of Majorana and (pseudo-)Dirac 
%sterile neutrinos for their most promising signatures, taking particular care
%over the polarization of the beam discussed in the previous section.

This analysis can be simplified by noting the following equivalences.
A Majorana neutrino $N$ decaying via a charged current process has the same differential %
decay rate as the Dirac neutrino $N_D$ with the appropriate lepton number, 
\[
	\dd{\Gamma}(N\to \ell_\alpha^- X^+) = \dd{\Gamma}(N_D\to \ell_\alpha^- X^+) \quad\text{and}\quad
	\dd{\Gamma}(N\to \ell_\alpha^+ X^-) = \dd{\Gamma}(\cj{N}_D\to \ell_\alpha^+ X^-)\ ,
\]
%
where we assume identical mass and mixing angles for both Dirac and Majorana neutrinos. 
%
This equivalence can be seen directly from the Feynman rules for Dirac and Majorana fermions~\cite{Denner:1992me} %
(see also \refref{Abada:2016plb}), but also explicitly in our formulae below.
%
In a neutral current (NC) decay, however, the two contractions of the NC operator lead to another contribution,  
%
\begin{equation*}
	%\label{eq:gamma_NC_sum}
	\dd{\Gamma}(N \to \nu X') = \dd{\Gamma}(N_D\to \nu X') + \dd{\Gamma}(\cj{N}_D\to\cj{\nu} X')\ .
\end{equation*}
%
These relations hold at the differential level if the kinematic variables are reinterpreted in the obvious way.
In this sense, we can view the Majorana process as the sum of Dirac particle and antiparticle decays.%
\footnote{In a general amplitude with Majorana states, there would also be an interference contribution between these two %
	sub-processes. However, in all cases of interest, interference diagrams are proportional to the %
	final-state light neutrino mass, which we take to be zero.} 
%
%If we consider the total decay rates only, we can make a further
%simplification if $Y$ is its own CP conjugate, $Y=\overline{Y}$. As CP
%violation requires the interference of strong and weak phases \cite{}, at
%tree-level these processes are identical $\Gamma(\overline{\nu}\to
%\overline{\nu} Y) = \Gamma(\overline{\nu}\to \overline{\nu} \overline{Y}) =
%\Gamma(\nu \to \nu Y)$.
%
Considering the total decay rates only, we find that the Majorana decay is larger by a factor of 2 compared to the Dirac case,
\[
	\Gamma(N\to \nu X' ) = 2\Gamma(N_D \to \nu X')\ .
\]
%
Note that this is true only for the total decay rates with massless final-state neutrinos.

\end{table}

It is instructive to reconsider this result in the light of the \emph{practical Dirac--Majorana confusion theorem}~\cite{Kayser:1981nw, %
	Kayser:1982br}.
In \refref{Kayser:1981nw}, the decomposition into particle and antiparticle processes was performed for %
Majorana neutrino--electron scattering via neutral current, leading to a factor of two enhancement in the total rate.
However, this enhancement was shown to be absent in practice due to the polarisation of the incoming neutrino, %
which suppresses the $\Delta L = 2$ contributions by factors of the neutrino mass. 
%
In the present case of nearly-sterile decay, where mass effects are large and essential to the calculation, %
there is no analogous effect: Dirac and Majorana neutrinos will have distinct total decay rates regardless of their polarisation. 
%
%In fact, we note that the helicity state of a massive fermion can never affect
%its total decay rate.%
%\footnote{This can be argued from the arbitrariness of the polarisation direction in the particle's rest frame, %
%or from the frame dependence of helicity for massive particles.}
%
Therefore, the total decay rates of heavy neutrinos into observable final states could in principle allow us to determine %
the Majorana/Dirac nature of the initial state.
This is not a trivial effect: a pure Majorana state decays with equal probability into $e^-\pi^+$ as $e^+ \pi^-$, %
one of its dominant and most experimentally distinctive branching decay modes, while a Dirac heavy neutrino %
will only decay into $e^-\pi^+$.
%
Assuming charge-identification is possible in the detector, distinguishing between the two total decay rates %
should be possible with modest statistics. %
%\footnote{Even if charged-ID is not available, some distributional distinctions can be made in principle, as we discuss later.}
In a charge-blind search or for an NC channel, the total decay rate of Majorana neutrinos would appear to be twice as large as that of Dirac neutrinos.
However, being the mixing usually an unknown quantity, the difference between Majorana and Dirac nature cannot be deduced as easily.

There is also a more subtle impact of the nature of the decaying neutrino.
%
Even though the total decay rate is not affected by the helicity of the initial neutrino, %
the helicity does affect the distributions of final state particles, which will in turn influence the observability of %
the signatures of neutrino decay. 
%
It is important that these polarisation effects are correctly implemented when studying the distributions of %
final state observables and subsequently when developing an analysis to tackle backgrounds. 

In the remainder of this section, we present results for the polarised heavy neutrino decay rates %
and distributions for Majorana and (pseudo-)Dirac neutrinos.
The decay modes considered are listed in~\reftab{tab:decays} and the respective branching ratios as functions of %
the neutrino mass are shown in~\reffig{fig:branch}.
%
The differential widths have been computed using the massive spinor helicity formalism %
(see \eg \refrefs{Dittmaier:1998nn, Diaz-Cruz:2016ahc}), and checked numerically using %
FeynCalc~\cite{Shtabovenko:2016sxi,Mertig:1990an}.

\subsection{Polarised Majorana neutrino decay}

Although spin-averaged Majorana neutrino decay rates are well known in the literature~\cite{Atre:2009rg,Gorbunov:2007ak,Helo:2010cw} %
(see also Ref.~\cite{Bondarenko:2018ptm}), to the best of our knowledge the polarised rates are not.
These are necessary to correctly describe the distributions of observables in a beam dump experiment, %
and in this section we present formulae for these differential decay rates. 

\newpage
Note that we stay agnostic as to the final nature and flavours of outgoing %
neutrinos, and in all cases sum over any possible outgoing states to define a %
semi-inclusive decay rate into the visible particle(s) $X'$, \ie 
%
\[
	\Gamma(N\to \nu X') \equiv \sum_{i=1}^3 \Gamma(N\to\nu_i X')\ .
\]
%
The alternative, chosen by many other authors, is to treat light neutrinos as Dirac particles, %
and construct the full decay width using arguments of CP invariance, %
in practice amounting to adding some judicious factors of two~\cite{Atre:2009rg,Bondarenko:2018ptm}.
Following this approach, our summed decay rate for $N\to\nu X'$ can be seen as 
%
\[
	\Gamma(N\to \nu X') \equiv \sum_{\alpha=e}^\tau \qty[\Gamma(N\to\nu_\alpha X') + %
	\Gamma(N\to\overline{\nu}_\alpha X')]\ .
\]
%
The two approaches are identical mathematical procedures and can both be used to compute the differential decay rates; %
however, we avoid the latter as the light neutrinos in most seesaw models are Majorana fermions, and making a distinction %
between $\nu_\alpha$ and $\overline{\nu}_\alpha$ is physically misleading.%
\footnote{The approach could be seen as a short-hand for decay rates into polarised massless neutrinos, %
	but as we are particularly concerned with polarisation effects in the beam this only adds a further complication.}
We also find that the distribution of events, the role of helicity and the heavy neutrino nature are obscured by this approach.
%
In contrast, by summing over all outgoing states, our formulae are insensitive to the Majorana/Dirac nature of the light neutrinos, %
and are the physically relevant rates necessary for comparison with beam dump experiments, as outgoing neutrinos are not reconstructed.

\subsubsection{Pseudoscalar mesons}
\label{sec:pseudoscalar}

The semi-leptonic meson decays are some of the most important channels identified in previous studies~\cite{Atre:2009rg, %
	Ballett:2016opr} (see also \refref{Asaka:2012bb}) %
thanks to their large branching ratios and distinctive final state particles.
Both charged and neutral pseudo-scalar mesons are viable final state particles, namely $P^\pm$ and $P^0$, %
and the decay widths are given in the Centre of Mass (CM) frame by
%
\begin{align}
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^- P^+) &= %
	|U_{\alpha N}|^2|V_{q\, \cj{q}}|^2  \frac{G_\text{F}^2f_P^2 m_N^3}{16\pi} %
	\ I^\pm_1 \qty(\xi^2_\alpha, \xi^2_P; \theta_\alpha)\ ,\label{eq:M_decay_pseudo_plus}\\
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^+ P^-) &= %
	|U_{\alpha N}|^2|V_{q\, \cj{q}}|^2  \frac{G_\text{F}^2f_P^2m_N^3}{16\pi} %
	\ I^\mp_1 \qty(\xi^2_\alpha, \xi^2_P; \theta_\alpha)\ ,\label{eq:M_decay_pseudo_minus}\\
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_P} \qty(N \to \nu P^0)\hphantom{{}^-} &= %
	\qty(\sum_{\alpha=e}^\tau| U_{\alpha N}|^2) \frac{G_\text{F}^2f_{P^0}^2m_N^3}{16\pi} %
	\ \frac{I_1 \qty(0, \xi^2_P)}{4\pi}\ ,\label{eq:M_decay_pseudo_0}
\end{align}
%
where $\Gamma_h$ is the decay rate for neutrinos of helicity $h$, %
$V_{q \cj{q}}$ is the appropriate CKM matrix element for the considered meson, $f_P$ is its decay constant %
and $\xi_i = m_i/m_N$ denotes the mass of the final state particle $i$ %
as a fraction of the initial state mass. 
The solid angle elements $\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}$ and $\Omega_P$ refer respectively to the charged lepton and %
pseudo-scalar meson angle with respect to the neutrino direction.
%
The kinematic function $I_1(x,y)$~\cite{Atre:2009rg} and its angular generalisation accounting for helicity, $I_1^\pm(x,y;\theta)$, %
are defined in \refapp{app:integrals}.
%
After integrating over the angular variables, we find that %
both the pseudo-scalar meson decay rates do not depend on helicity, as expected,
%
%	\begin{align*}
%		\Gamma_\pm \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^- P^+) &= %
%		\frac{G_F^2}{16\pi} f_P^2\, |V_{q\, \cj{q}}|^2\, |U_{\alpha 4}|^2 m_N^3\,\lambda^\frac{1}{2}(1, \xi_\alpha, \xi_P) %
%		\qty[(1-\xi_\alpha)^2 - \xi_P(1+\xi_\alpha)]\ ,\\
%		\Gamma_\pm \qty(N \to \nu_\alpha P^0) &= 
%		\frac{G_F^2}{16\pi} f_P^2\, |U_{\alpha 4}|^2 m_N^3\, \qty(1-\xi_P^2)^2\ .
%	\end{align*}
%
\begin{align}
	\Gamma_\pm \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^- P^+) &= \Gamma_\pm \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^+ P^-) = %
	|V_{q\, \cj{q}}|^2 |U_{\alpha N}|^2 \frac{G_F^2f_P^2m_N^3}{16\pi}\ I_1\qty(\xi^2_\alpha, \xi^2_P)\ ,\\
	\Gamma_\pm \qty(N \to \nu P^0)\hphantom{{}^-} &= \left(\sum_{\alpha=e}^\tau|U_{\alpha N}|^2\right) %
	\frac{G_F^2f_P^2m_N^3}{16\pi}\ I_1\qty(0,\xi^2_P)\ .
\end{align}
%
These rates agree with those presented in \refrefs{Bondarenko:2018ptm,Gorbunov:2007ak} %
(correcting a factor of two discrepancy in the $\nu P^0$ rate of \refrefs{Atre:2009rg,Helo:2010cw}).

The decay into a neutral meson, in \refeq{eq:M_decay_pseudo_0}, is isotropic in the rest frame, while the charged-pion modes, %
\refeqs{eq:M_decay_pseudo_plus}{eq:M_decay_pseudo_minus}, inherit their angular dependence from $I^\pm(x, y; \theta_\alpha)$, %
on the lepton angle to the beam line in the heavy neutrino rest frame $\theta_\alpha$.
%
The isotropy of the neutral current decay $N\to\nu P^0$ is a manifestation of %
the Majorana nature of the particle, in agreement with the discussion of \refref{Balantekin:2018ukw}.
It is worth noting that, if final states are not charge-identified, a similar isotropy %
is obtained for the total rate of charged semi-leptonic decays, 
%
\begin{align}  
	%
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha P) &\equiv
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^+ P^-) +
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^- P^+) \notag \\
	%
	&= |U_{\alpha N}|^2|V_{q\, \cj{q}}|^2  \frac{G_\text{F}^2f_P^2m_N^3}{16\pi}
	\ \frac{I_1 \qty(\xi^2_\alpha, \xi^2_P)}{2\pi}\ . 
	%
\end{align}
%

The formulae above apply for all pseudo-scalar mesons which are kinematically allowed.
For instance, below the $K^0$ mass, the heavy neutrino can decay only into pions, %
but above $\eta$ and $\eta'$ can be allowed in the final state.
%but for heavier masses 
%However, for steriles produced by $D_s$ meson decay, a charged kaon in the final state is also possible.
%For masses towards the upper limit of our range, decays into $\tau$ final states are also possible, %
%\eg $N \to \tau^\mp \pi^\pm$, but the smaller phase space makes them negligible for the present work.
%The same conclusion is true for the mode $e^\mp D^\pm$.
%	
% The neutral pion is the only neutral pseudoscalar meson below the $K^0$ mass.
%Above this limit, the channels with an $\eta$ or an $\eta'$ in the final state become allowed.
%The majority of neutral pseudoscalar mesons decay electromagnetically into two photons or multi-pion final states. 

\subsubsection{Vector mesons}

Although only for higher masses, HNL can also decay into vector mesons $V$, %
both via charged current, $N \to \ell^\mp V^\pm$, and neutral current, $N \to \nu V^0$.
We find the following polarised differential distributions in the heavy neutrino rest frame, 
%
\begin{align}
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^- V^+) &= %
	|U_{\alpha N}|^2 |V_{q\, \cj{q}}|^2 \frac{G_\text{F}^2f_V^2 m_N^3}{16\pi} %
	\ I^\pm_2\qty(\xi^2_\alpha, \xi^2_V; \theta_\alpha)\ ,\label{eq:M_decay_vector_plus}\\
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^+ V^-) &= %
	|U_{\alpha N}|^2  |V_{q\, \cj{q}}|^2\frac{G_\text{F}^2f_V^2m_N^3}{16\pi} %
	\ I^\mp_2 \qty(\xi^2_\alpha, \xi^2_V; \theta_\alpha)\ ,\label{eq:M_decay_vector_minus}\\
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_V} \qty(N \to \nu V^0)\hphantom{{}^-} &= %
	\qty(\sum_{\alpha=e}^\tau| U_{\alpha N}|^2 ) %
	\frac{G_\text{F}^2f_{V}^2\kappa_V^2m_N^3}{16\pi}\ \frac{I_2 \qty(0, \xi^2_V)}{4\pi}\label{eq:M_decay_vector_0}\ ,
\end{align}
%
where $I_2(x,y)$ and $I_2^\pm(x,y;\theta)$ are defined in \refapp{app:integrals}.
%
We find the total decay widths given by
%
\begin{align}
	\Gamma\qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^- V^+) &=  \Gamma\qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^+ V^-) = %
	|U_{\alpha N}|^2 |V_{q\,\cj{q}}|^2 \frac{G_F^2 f_V^2m_N^3}{16\pi}\ I_2\qty(\xi^2_\alpha,\xi^2_V)\ ,\\
	\Gamma\qty(N \to \nu V^0)\hphantom{{}^-} &= \left(\sum_{\alpha = e}^\tau |U_{\alpha N}|^2\right) %
	\frac{G_F^2f_V^2\kappa_V^2  m_N^3}{16\pi}\ I_2\qty(0,\xi^2_V)\ ,
\end{align}
%
where the constants $\kappa_V$ are combinations of the Weinberg angle, depending on the flavour structure of $V^0$ (see below).
Our charged pseudo-vector decay rates agrees with \refrefs{Bondarenko:2018ptm, Atre:2009rg, Helo:2010cw, Gorbunov:2007ak} while %
our neutral pseudo-scalar calculation agrees with the corrected version presented in \refref{Bondarenko:2018ptm}.

As with the pseudo-scalar meson decay rates, the Majorana nature leads to an isotropic decay into a neutral vector meson.
An analogous effect holds for the charged vector meson decay if we assume that the charges of final state particles %
are not distinguished.
In this case, we find the physically relevant decay distribution in the particle rest frame to be given~by
%
\begin{align}
	%
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha V) &\equiv \dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} %
	\qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^- V^+) + \dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^+ V^-)\ , \notag\\
	%
	&= |U_{\alpha N}|^2 \frac{G_\text{F}^2f_V^2}{16\pi} |V_{q\, \cj{q}}|^2\, m_N^3 %
	\ \frac{I_2 \qty(\xi^2_\alpha, \xi^2_V)}{2\pi}\ .
	%
\end{align}
%
There are no vector mesons lighter than the $K^0$, and these decays become relevant only for higher masses %
for which decays into $\rho^\pm$ and $K^{*\pm}$, and for the neutral mode into $\rho^0$, $\omega$, and $\phi$ would be relevant.
For these neutral particles, the $\kappa_V$ factors read
\[
	\kappa_\rho   = 1-\sin^2\theta_W \quad,\quad
	\kappa_\omega = \frac{4}{3} \sin^2\theta_W \quad,\quad
	\kappa_\phi   = \frac{4}{3} \sin^2\theta_W -1\ .
\]
%Vector mesons usually into a multi-state of pseudoscalar mesons, depending on the initial flavour content,
%sometimes accompanied by photon emission making their reconstruction challenging from an experimental point of view.

\subsubsection{Charged lepton pairs}

%The differential decay rates for these modes are more complicated to write
%down, but we give compact formulae for these channels in
%App.~\ref{app:threebody_dist}. 
%
We assign the momenta to the particles in the three-body decay as follows
%
\[
	N(k_1) \to \nu(k_2)\, \ell_\alpha^-(k_3)\,\ell^+_\beta(k_4)\ ,
\] 
%
and denote $k_i^2 = m_i^2$.
The five-dimensional phase space of the final-state particles can be parameterised using two scaled invariant masses,
%
\[
	s_1=\frac{(k_2+k_3)^2}{m_N^2} \qquad \text{and} \qquad s_2=\frac{(k_2+k_4)^2}{m_N^2}\ ,
\] 
%
as well as three lab-frame angular variables, $(\theta_3, \phi_3)$, giving the direction of $\ell^-_\alpha$ and $\varphi_{43}$ %
denoting the relative azimuthal angle between $\ell^-_\alpha$ and $\ell^+_\beta$. 
%
Although $\cos\theta_4$ is not an independent element of our parametrisation, it is a physically relevant quantity %
and we use it to simplify the presentation of the distributions below.
It can be easily related to the fundamental variables $s_1,s_2,\theta_3,\varphi_3, \varphi_{43}$.
%
The differential decay rate is expressed as
%
\begin{equation}  
	\label{eq:threebody_dist_master}
	\dd{\Gamma_\pm} = \frac{G_F^2 m_N^5}{16 \pi^3} \qty(|A_0|^2\pm|A_1|^2) %
	\dd{s_1} \dd{s_2}\, \frac{\dd[2]{\Omega_3}}{4\pi}\ \frac{\dd{\varphi_{43}}}{2\pi}\ ,
\end{equation}
%
where $\Omega_3$ assumes the conventional meaning and with
\begin{align}
	%
	|A_0|^2 &\equiv C_1 \qty(s_2-\xi^2_3) \qty(1+\xi^2_4-s_2) + C_2 \qty(s_1-\xi^2_4) \qty(1+\xi^2_3-s_1) \notag \\
	\label{eq:threebody_1}
	&\qquad + 2\,C_3\,\xi_3\,\xi_4 \qty(s_1+s_2 - \xi^2_3 - \xi^2_4)\ , \\
	%
	|A_1|^2 &\equiv \qty[ C_4 \qty(s_2-\xi_3^2) - 2\,C_6\,\xi_3\,\xi_4]\kallen(1,s_2,\xi_4^2)\cos\theta_4 \notag \\
	\label{eq:threebody_2}
	&\qquad + \qty[C_5 \qty(s_1-\xi_4^2) - 2\,C_6\,\xi_3\,\xi_4]\kallen(1,s_1,\xi_3^2)\cos\theta_3\ .   
	%
\end{align}
%
%with $\Gamma_h$ denoting the decay rate of a heavy neutrino with
%helicity $h$. 
%
The coefficients $\{C_i\}$ are polynomials in chiral couplings and extended PMNS matrix elements, %
and are given for the decays of interest in \refapp{app:threebody_dist}. 
On integration over the angular coordinates, however, only the $|A_0|^2$ terms remain %
and we recover the standard expression for the total decay rates through the %
identities given in \refeqss{eq:threebody_int1}{eq:threebody_int2}{eq:threebody_int3}. 
%
The general expression for the total decay rate is again helicity independent and can be written as
%
\begin{equation}
	\Gamma_\pm = \frac{G_F^2 m_N^5}{192 \pi^3}\,\qty[ C_1\ I_1\qty(0,\xi_3^2,\xi_4^2) + %
	C_2\ I_1\qty(0,\xi_4^2,\xi_3^2) + C_3\ I_2\qty(0,\xi_3^2,\xi_4^2) ]\ .
\end{equation}
%
The functions $I_1\qty(x,y,z)$ and $I_2\qty(x,y,z)$ are given in \refapp{app:integrals}. 
%
Using the expressions for $\{C_i\}$ in \refapp{app:threebody_dist}, %
we find that the total decay rates are given to first order in the heavy-active mixing parameters $U_{\alpha N}$ by
%
\begin{align}
	%
	&\Gamma_\pm\qty(N \to \nu \ell_\alpha^- \ell_\beta^+) = 
	\frac{G_F^2m_N^5}{192\pi^3}\ \qty[ |U_{\alpha N}|^2\ I_1 \qty(0, \xi_\alpha^2, \xi_\beta^2) + %
	|U_{\beta N}|^2\ I_1\qty(0, \xi_\beta^2, \xi_\alpha^2)]\ ,\\
	%
	&\Gamma_\pm\qty(N \to \nu \ell_\alpha^- \ell_\alpha^+) = %
	\frac{G_F^2 m_N^5}{96\pi^3} \sum_{\gamma=e}^\tau |U_{\gamma N}|^2 %
	\Big\{\qty(g_L g_R + \delta_{\gamma \alpha} g_R)\  I_2 \qty(0, \xi_\alpha^2, \xi_\alpha^2)  \notag \\
	&\hspace{15em}+ \qty[g_L^2 + g_R^2 + \delta_{\gamma \alpha} (1+2g_L)]%
	\ I_1 \qty(0, \xi_\alpha^2, \xi_\alpha^2)\Big\}\ . 
\end{align}	
%
where $\alpha \neq \beta$, $g_L = -1/2 + \sin^2\theta_\text{W}$ and $g_R =\sin^2\theta_\text{W}$.
Our total decay rates agree with those in \refrefs{Bondarenko:2018ptm, Atre:2009rg, Helo:2010cw, Gorbunov:2007ak} %
and correct a typographical mistake in the rates presented in \refref{Ballett:2016opr}. 

All possible combinations of charged leptons except $\nu \tau^- \tau^+$ are allowed for masses below~$m_{D_s}$.
However, because of the limited phase space, the decays into $\nu \tau^\mp e^\pm$ and $\nu \tau^\mp \mu^\pm$ can be neglected.	

\subsubsection{Other decays}

There are some other decay rates relevant to this study but not as viable observable channels.
First, the total decay width of the process $N \to \nu \bar{\nu} \nu$, mediated by the $Z$ boson, reads
%
\begin{equation}
	\Gamma\qty(N \to \nu \bar{\nu} \nu) = \left(\sum_{\gamma = e}^\tau|U_{\gamma 4}|^2\right) \frac{G_F^2m_N^5}{96\pi^3}\ .
\end{equation}
%
Although this decay mode is experimentally invisible, it is the dominant channel up to the pion mass, %
when two-body semi-leptonic decays open up, and plays a significant role in defining the branching ratios of the observable channels.
Our expression agrees with \refrefs{Bondarenko:2018ptm,Atre:2009rg,Helo:2010cw,Gorbunov:2007ak}.
%
Secondly, there are other decay modes with small branching ratios and/or complicated final states which we do not study further.
These include the one-loop decay into a photon which has received some interest as an observable signature %
in non-minimal models~\cite{Gninenko:2009ks,Gninenko:2010pr,Magill:2018jla} where it may be enhanced. %
In the mass models considered in this work, it has a branching ratio of below $10^{-3}$ and will not be considered. 
%
%   The total decay width in the minimal model considered here is
%
%  	\begin{equation}
% 		\Gamma\qty(N \to \nu \gamma) = \frac{27\alpha_\text{EM}}{32\pi} \sum_\alpha %\frac{G_F^2}{192\pi^3} |U_{\alpha 4}|^2 m_N^5\ .
%	\end{equation}
%
We also neglect the multi-pion decay modes discussed in \refref{Bondarenko:2018ptm}, %
which are estimated to have at most a percent level branching ratio and a challenging hadronic final state for reconstruction. 

\subsection{Polarised (pseudo-)Dirac neutrino decay}

In this section we compute the decay rates for pseudo-Dirac pairs.
It is unlikely that any effect driven by the LNV parameter will be relevant for the discovery potential of DUNE ND %
and the signatures of these particles will be dominated by the leading order LNC effects.
Accordingly, we take the strict Dirac limit in our calculations, rather than treating the states as pseudo-Dirac pairs.
%It is worth bearing in mind that all mass eigenstates under consideration are strictly Majorana.

\subsubsection{Dirac (anti)neutrino decays}

The decay rates for a Dirac heavy (anti)neutrino are similar in form to those presented for the Majorana neutrino.
The key differences are lepton number conservation, which acts to forbid certain channels, and differences in %
the angular distributions of the neutral current decays.
For charged current--mediated processes, the distributions for Dirac neutrinos and antineutrinos %
are mathematically identical to the distributions for Majorana neutrinos.
The two-body semi-leptonic decays are the same of \refeqs{eq:M_decay_pseudo_plus}{eq:M_decay_vector_plus},
\begin{align}
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(N_D \to \ell_\alpha^- P^+) &= %
	\dv{\Gamma_\mp}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(\cj{N}_D \to \ell_\alpha^+ P^-) = % 
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^- P^+) \ ,   \\
	%	|U_{\alpha N}|^2|V_{q\, \cj{q}}|^2  \frac{G_\text{F}^2f_P^2 m_N^3}{16\pi} %
	%	\ I^\pm_1 \qty(\xi_\alpha^2, \xi_P^2; \theta_\alpha)\ ,\\
	%
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(N_D \to \ell_\alpha^- V^+) &= %
	\dv{\Gamma_\mp}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(\cj{N}_D \to \ell_\alpha^+ V^-)  = %
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^- V^+)\ .
	%|U_{\alpha N}|^2  |V_{q\, \cj{q}}|^2\frac{G_\text{F}^2f_V^2m_N^3}{16\pi} %:
	%\ I^\pm_2 \qty(\xi_\alpha^2, \xi_V^2; \theta_\alpha)\ ,\\
	%
\end{align}
The situation for NC processes is different with respect to Majorana neutrinos.
The distribution of the final state particles is not isotropic anymore and it depends on the helicity state of the initial neutrino, %
in the way shown by the following differential rates
%
%	\begin{align*}
%		\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_\alpha} \qty(N_D \to \ell_\alpha^- P^+) &= %
%	|U_{\alpha 4}|^2|V_{q\, \cj{q}}|^2  \frac{G_\text{F}^2f_P^2 m_N^3}{16\pi} I^\pm_1 (\xi_\alpha, \xi_P; \theta_\alpha),\\
%		\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_\alpha} \qty(N_D \to \ell_\alpha^- V^+) &= %
%	|U_{\alpha 4}|^2 \frac{G_\text{F}^2f_V^2}{16\pi} |V_{q\, \cj{q}}|^2\, m_N^3\, I^\pm_2 (\xi_\alpha, \xi_V; \theta_\alpha),\\
%		\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_P} \qty(N_D \to \nu P^0) &= %
%	 \left(\sum_{\alpha=e}^\tau| U_{\alpha 4}|^2\right)\frac{G_\text{F}^2f_{P^0}^2m_N^3}{32\pi} I_1^\pm (0, \xi_P; \theta_P),\\
%		\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_V} \qty(N_D \to \nu V^0) &= %
%	 \left(\sum_{\alpha=e}^\tau| U_{\alpha 4}|^2\right)\frac{G_\text{F}^2f_{V}^2\kappa_V^2m_N^3}{32\pi} I^\mp_2 (0, \xi_V;\theta_V).

All decay rates not listed above are forbidden for a Dirac (anti)particle as the combination of production %
and decay would amount to a LNV process.
% 
For the available modes, all NC modes are smaller by a factor of two for a Dirac (anti)neutrino compared %
to the equivalent Majorana process; however, the major difference we see between the Dirac (anti)neutrino and Majorana distributions %
is that these NC channels are dependent on the angular variables.
These differences in the distributions of the final state particles could be in principle exploited to identify %
the fermionic nature of the decaying HNL~\cite{Balantekin:2018ukw}.


\section{Heavy neutrino production}
\label{sec:production}

Heavy neutrinos can be produced in a beam dump experiment via the same processes %
that generate light neutrinos.
A proton beam hitting a fixed target typically yields a large number of pions and kaons, %
and also heavier mesons, the amount of which depends on the energy of the protons and the target choice.
A set of magnetic horns is responsible for the focusing of charged pions into a decay pipe; %
the other short-lived particles are usually unaffected by the deflection.
All these secondary particles decay leptonically or semi-leptonically via weak interactions thus creating a neutrino beam.
In the standard case of light neutrinos, pions and kaons principally decay into $\nu_\mu$ because two-body electronic modes are disfavoured %
by helicity suppression.
Muons decay in turn into equal numbers of $\nu_e$ and $\cj{\nu}_\mu$.
Other production sources of $\nu_e$ are the three-body decays of $K^0$ and $K^+$.
Above the neutral kaon mass, the first sizeable source of neutrino is given by the $D_s$ meson, %
for which helicity suppression again favours the production of heavy charged-leptons, %
and so $\tau$~leptons and $\nu_\tau$ are more likely to be emitted than the other flavours.
Each of the subsequent $\tau^+$ decays produces~a~$\cj{\nu}_\tau$.
We consider only the four most probable decay modes of the $\tau$ lepton, %
as they provide a sufficient description of their contribution to the overall flux.%
\footnote{The decay $\tau^+ \to \cj{\nu}_\tau \pi^+ \pi^0$ is studied only at the level of %
	phase space sampling in this work.}

If kinematically allowed, heavy neutrino states can be sourced from these decays of mesons and charged leptons.
We show in~\reftab{tab:branch} all the neutrino production channels considered in this analysis, %
reporting the heaviest neutrino mass $m_N$ that is accessible by kinematics.
%On the left, all the viable channels up to the $K^0$ mass are listed.
The neutrino mass range we consider goes from a few MeV up to the $D_s$ meson mass.
%{\color{green!70!black} I DO NOT THINK THIS GOES HERE. In fact the discussion above refers only to the case of light neutrinos as things are different for heavy ones. So I think we should just refer to the standard case in this paragraph, and then have the discussion of the heavy neutrinos in the two subsections below. .... The mass range considered spans therefore from a few keV up to $m_{D_s}-m_e$, if the heavy neutrino is %
%generated via non-zero electron mixing in the decay $D_s^+ \to e^+ N$. SO I CHANGED IT TO THE STATEMENT BELOW. IF YOU AGREE, PLEASE DELETE THIS ALL RED PARAGRAPH.}
To~estimate the flux of heavy neutrinos produced, we start from the flux of light neutrinos, %
scaling it by an energy-independent kinematic factor.
Given a certain SM neutrino production process, $Q \to \nu_\alpha Q'$, %
we use as scale factor the ratio between the decay width of the same process producing massive neutrinos, %
$Q \to N Q'$, and the rate of the SM decay with light neutrinos.
%The flux of light neutrinos $\nu_\alpha$ produced from the leptonic or semi-leptonic decay of a %
%given parent particle $P \to \nu_\alpha + X$ can be scaled to obtain an approximate heavy neutrino flux.
%Neglecting energy dependence, a simple scale factor is given by the ratio of the partial decay widths computed %
%in the model with an extra neutrino with respect to the width in the SM.
The full flux of nearly-sterile neutrinos with a given helicity is therefore a linear combination of the different neutrino flux components, %
$\phi_{Q \to\nu_\alpha}$, summing over all existing parents and all allowed flavours:
%
\begin{equation}
	\dv{\phi_N^\pm}{E} (E_N) \approx \sum_{Q, \alpha}  \mathcal{K}^{Q,\alpha}_\pm(m_N)\ \dv{\phi_{Q\to\nu_\alpha}}{E} (E_N - m_N)\ , %
\end{equation}
where
\[
	\mathcal{K}^{Q,\alpha}_\pm(m_N) \equiv \frac{\Gamma_\pm(Q \to N Q')}{\Gamma(Q \to \nu_\alpha Q')}\ .
\]
%
The ratio $\mathcal{K}$ is proportional to the mixing parameter $|U_{\alpha N}|^2$ and contains only kinematic %
functions of the involved masses.
These are responsible for correcting phase space and helicity terms.
%{\color{blue} I changed X and Y to Q and Q' as we have used X and Y earlier to indicate the decay products of the heavy neutrinos.}

The helicity state plays a fundamental role in the production rate, in contrast with the case of neutrino decays, %
since there is no arbitrariness in the polarisation direction this time: %
it is defined by the neutrino momentum in the rest frame of the parent particle.
We employ the massive spinor helicity formalism to compute the production decay rates for both Majorana and Dirac neutrinos, %
and these are used to build the scale factors for each neutrino helicity.
Even though lepton number is preserved differently in the two cases and different Feynman rules hold, %
all the production channels of interest in this work are mediated by charge currents %
and therefore the rates are mathematically identical for Majorana and Dirac neutrinos.
If the neutrino is Dirac, the production decay width for an antineutrino with given helicity is the same %
as the one of the neutrino, but with opposite helicity.
%If the neutrino is Majorana, talking about particle and antiparticle becomes meaningless and only helicity states exist.
The phenomenology of the scale factors is different for two-body decays and three-body decays and therefore we group them, %
respectively, in~\refsec{sec:production_2body} and~\refsec{sec:production_3body}.

\subsection{Two-body decays}
\label{sec:production_2body}

A massless neutrino (antineutrino) has its chiral and helicity states degenerate, and so %
it is always produced with a negative (positive) helicity.
It follows that the component of the light neutrino beam produced in two-body decays of pseudo-scalar mesons is polarised.
The initial spin, which is zero, must be preserved in the decay, and since the helicity of the neutrino in the rest frame %
is fixed, the accompanying lepton is produced with a ``wrong'' helicity.
This is permitted by the non-zero mass of the charged lepton and %
%It follows that decay modes of pseudoscalar mesons with lighter leptons, e.g.\ $\pi^+\to \nu_e e^+$, are suppressed %
%and channels with heavier flavours, e.g.\ $\pi^+\to\nu_\mu \mu^+$, are favoured instead.
therefore final states with light flavour leptons undergo helicity suppression.
As soon as the neutrino mass deviates from zero, the correspondence between chirality and helicity is lost %
and the neutrino can be produced with both polarisations.
The main consequence is that the production of heavy neutrinos from light flavour mixings (electron) appears to be enhanced with %
respect to heavy flavours (muon and tau).
The effect is particularly dramatic when the mass difference between parent meson and charged lepton widens, %
as it happens with the electron decay of $D_s$, the enhancement of which is around \np{e6} for neutrino masses near 1\,GeV.

	\caption{The scale factors separated by helicity components are shown.
		In two-body decays (left), the $h=-1$ components (dashed) for all channels %
		do not depend on the mass.
		The enhancement is driven by the $h=+1$ components (dotted), %
		which are the dominant contribution of the unpolarised factors (solid).
		In three-body decays (right), there are two different scale factors for purely leptonic decays, noted as $\ell_\alpha \to \ell_\beta$: %
		if the decay is mediated by $|U_{\beta N}|^2$, for which the $h=-1$ (dashed) and the $h=+1$ (dotted) components %
		are comparable, and if the decay is mediated by $|U_{\alpha N}|^2$, %
		for which $h=-1$ dominates over the $h=+1$ (dotdashed).
		In both cases, the two parts sum up to the same quantity (solid).
		The kaon decays are also divided in $h=-1$ (dashed) and $h=+1$ (dotted) components; $\tau^+\to\nu\pi^+\pi^0$ is %
		studied only at the phase space~level.}

\end{figure}

%\clearpage
The scale factor $\mathcal{K}_h$ for leptonic decays of a pseudo-scalar meson $P$ into neutrinos with helicity $h$, 
is given by the analytic expression:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:shrock_helix}
	\mathcal{K}_\pm^{P, \alpha}(m_N) = |U_{\alpha N}|^2 %
	\frac{\kallen(1,\ \xi_N^2,\ \xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2) \qty[\xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2+\xi_N^2-(\xi_N^2-\xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2)^2 %
		\pm(\xi_N^2-\xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2) \kallen(1,\ \xi_N^2,\ \xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2) ] }%
	{2 \xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2(1-\xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2)^2}\ ,
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the K\"all\'en function:
\[
	\lambda(a, b, c) = (a-b-c)^2-4\,b\,c\ ,
\]
and $\xi_i = \flatfrac{m_i}{m_X}$ is the mass ratio of the final state particle $i$ over the parent particle mass.
When summing over the helicity states, the resulting factor coincides with the one computed in~\refref{Shrock:1981wq}:
\begin{equation*}
	\mathcal{K}^{P, \alpha}(m_N) = \sum_{h = \pm 1} \mathcal{K}_h^{P, \alpha}(m_N) = |U_{\alpha N}|^2 %
	\frac{\kallen(1,\ \xi_N^2,\ \xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2) \qty[\xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2+\xi_N^2-(\xi_N^2-\xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2)^2]}%
	{\xi_\alpha^2(1-\xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2)^2}\ .
\end{equation*}
In order to understand the effect of~\refeq{eq:shrock_helix}, it is convenient to define the fraction of neutrinos produced with a certain helicity as
\begin{equation*}
	S_\pm = \frac{\mathcal{K}_\pm^{P, \alpha}}{\mathcal{K}_{+1}^{P, \alpha} + \mathcal{K}_{-1}^{P, \alpha}} = 
	\frac{1}{2} \left[ 1 \pm \frac{(\xi_N^2-\xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2)\ \kallen(1,\ \xi_N^2, %
			\ \xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2)}{\xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2+\xi_N^2-(\xi_N^2-\xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2)^2}\right].
\end{equation*}
In the limit of a massless neutrino, i.e.\ $\xi_N \to 0$, the fractions are $S_+ \to 0$ and $S_- \to 1$, as expected: %
all neutrinos are produced with a negative helicity.
The opposite is true when the charged lepton is in the massless limit, and the neutrinos are produced with a positive~helicity.

The only two-body decay of a lepton considered in this work is $\tau \to \nu_\tau \pi$, and the scale factor is:
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{K}_\pm^{\tau, \pi}(m_N) = |U_{\tau N}|^2 %
	\frac{\kallen(1,\ \xi_N^2,\ \xi_\pi^2) \qty[(1-\xi_N^2)^2 + \xi_\pi^2(1+\xi_N^2) \mp %
		(1 - \xi_N^2) \kallen(1,\ \xi_N^2,\ \xi_\pi^2) ] }%
	{2 (1-\xi_\pi^2)^2}\ .
\end{equation}
The structure is similar to the scale factor for pseudo-scalar meson two-body decays, given in~\refeq{eq:shrock_helix}, %
and analogous considerations as above can be deduced.
This is explained by crossing symmetries, as the matrix element of the process is the same.
In this case, however, the positive helicity component does not lead to any enhancement before %
the phase space~cut-off.

The effect of the scale factors as a function of the neutrino mass can be appreciated in~\reffig{fig:scale}, %
where not only helicity terms are corrected, resulting in an enhancement of the production, but also the phase space %
is properly adjusted.

\subsection{Three-body decays}
\label{sec:production_3body}

%For three-body decays, the analogous factor cannot be easily computed analytically.
%We evaluate these factors numerically, as described in App.~\ref{sec:appscaling}.
Scale factors for three-body decays are defined in the same way as two-body decay ones.
Because of the different number of degrees of freedom, the helicity of the outgoing neutrinos is not fixed by %
the spin of the parent particles.
Hence, these factors are not responsible for any enhancement in the decay rate, %
but they only quench the process as the neutrino mass upper limit is approached (see~\reftab{tab:branch}).
The scale factors have nonetheless distinct behaviours depending on the helicity state involved.
Their behaviour is plotted as a function of the heavy neutrino mass in~\reffig{fig:scale}.

The decay of a charged lepton (antilepton) of flavour $\alpha$ to a charged lepton (antilepton) of flavour $\beta$ %
can be proportional to either $|U_{\alpha N}|^2$ or $|U_{\beta N}|^2$, producing a heavy Dirac neutrino (antineutrino) in the first case %
or an antineutrino (neutrino) in the second case.
If the neutrino is Majorana, the decay can occur via both mixing matrix elements because lepton number can be violated.
Decays of muons and taus yield massive neutrinos with the following decay rate%\marcom{PB}{I fiddled. Do you agree this holds for Maj. and Dir.?}

	|U_{\beta N}|^2\ I^\pm_{\cj{\ell}}\qty(0, \xi_{\ell_\beta}^2, \xi_N^2)]\ ,
\end{align}
%
where the integrals $I_{\ell, \cj{\ell}}(x, y, z)$ are given in~\refapp{app:integrals}.
The helicity decompositions in $I_\ell$ and $I_{\cj{\ell}}$ are different, %
but the spin-averaged decay width is the same. %\marcom{PB}{To be finished?}

Neutral and charged kaons produce neutrinos in three-body semi-leptonic decays.
Both of them can decay into either a muon or an electron %
and a charged pion if the decaying kaon is neutral or a neutral pion if the kaon is charged.
The decay width of a pseudo-scalar meson $h_1$ to a lighter meson $h_2$ is given by
\begin{equation}
	\Gamma_\pm (h_1^{+,0} \to h_2^{0,+}\,\ell_\alpha^+ N) = \frac{G_F^2 m_h^5}{128 \pi^3} |U_{\alpha N}|^2 |V_{q\cj{q}}|^2\ %
	I^\pm_{h_1} \qty(\xi_{h_2}^2, \xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2, \xi_N^2)\ .
\end{equation}
The integral $I_h(x, y, z)$ is reported in~\refapp{app:integrals} and consists of a combination %
of kinematic elements with terms of hadronic form factors as coefficients.
The scale factor was checked numerically against the result of~\refref{Abada:2013aba}.
%From lattice QCD considerations, the decay width is halved when the decay is into $\pi^0$, %
%even though this is irrelevant for the scale factor.

The final three-body decay studied in this work is $\tau^+ \to \cj{\nu}_\tau \pi^+ \pi^0$, %
however this channel is introduced only at the phase space level.
The scale factors for the two helicity components are therefore assumed to be identical, %
$\mathcal{K}_\pm = \smash[b]{\frac{1}{2}}$, such that the neutrino flux sub-component coming from this decay %
consists of equal number of heavy neutrinos with helicity $h=+1$ and $h=-1$.

\section{Simulation of events at DUNE ND}
\label{sec:experiment}

DUNE~\cite{Abi:2018dnh} is a long-baseline oscillation experiment that will study neutrino physics in great detail, %
focusing mainly on the determination of the CP violating phase, $\delta_\text{CP}$, %
of the mass ordering, %
%i.e.\ the sign of $\Delta m_{31}^2$,
and on the precision measurement of other oscillation parameters, in particular $\theta_{23}$.
These goals can be achieved thanks to both an intense neutrino beam and a high-resolution Far Detector (FD), %
consisting of a 40\,kt Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC), situated \np{1300}\,km from the beam target.
The drift velocity of ionised electrons in LAr, typically of the order of cm/\textmu s, %
can be controlled with sufficient precision, by tuning the electric field, %
to result in high spatial resolution for event reconstruction~\cite{Rubbia:1977zz}.
%The c
%with liquefied argon instead of its gaseous phase.
%The LAr is advantageous compared to the gaseous counterpart because it is around one thousand times denser, %
%increasing the interaction probability, which is valuable for neutrino physics.
%Employing very pure argon, the recombination of released electrons can be reduced and %
%so the LArTPC design can be scaled to large volumes, as it will be done for DUNE.
%LAr also scintillates with a high light yield, around 40 photons/keV, but, differently from other liquefied noble gasses, %
%LAr is transparent to its scintillation wavelength, which peaks at \np{126.8}~nm.
%A photo-detection system can collect the scintillation light giving an additional handle on event reconstruction.
%All these exceptional properties make LArTPC a powerful tool for precision neutrino physics.
A very sensitive FD alone, however, is not enough due to numerous uncertainties on neutrino flux and cross sections.
A smaller and closer detector, called Near Detector (ND), is therefore adopted to normalise the flux of neutrinos reaching the FD and to help cancel out many of %
the neutrino-nucleon cross section systematics.

The DUNE ND will be placed \np{574}\,m from the target.
Its final design has not been finalised yet, but it will likely be a hybrid concept, %
consisting of a small LArTPC placed in front of a magnetised high-pressure gaseous TPC.
This module is complementary to the front detector, controlling escaping or below-threshold particles from the LArTPC, %
but is also capable of performing standalone measurement.
For its versatile nature, it is called Multi-Purpose Detector (MPD).
The sub-system LArTPC/MPD will be movable inside the ND hall---following the DUNE-PRISM concept---for better profiling the neutrino flux %
at different angles.
There will be a third module, a 3D Scintillation Tracker (3DST), on-axis, to monitor %
the stability of the beam flux and neutron contamination.
Currently, the proposed fiducial volume for the LArTPC module is 24\,m\tapi{3} (around 35\,t of LAr), employing the ArgonCube technology~\cite{Amsler:1993255}, %
whereas the design for the MPD is based on the TPC in \mbox{ALICE}~\cite{Glassel:2004jv}, %
a cylinder of 100\,m\tapi{3} with gas at a pressure of 10\,atm and a fiducial mass of~1\,t.
The~3DST is designed to have a fiducial mass of around \np{8.7}\,t of plastic scintillating material and %
wavelength shifting plates.
%($3\times2\times6$)\,m\tapi{3},
%and for the HPArFGT is ($3.5\times3.5\times6.4$)\,m\tapi{3}.
For this analysis, we take only in account the two core sub-detectors, the LArTPC and the MPD.
The main difference between these two ND modules is that the gaseous TPC has a larger volume than the LArTPC.
This feature is favourable for studying rare events, like heavy neutrino decays, because more neutrinos enter the fiducial volume.
Furthermore, the lower density of the MPD helps reduce the number of neutrino scattering events, which are background to rare signatures.
Apart from volume and density differences and relative positions in the detector hall, %
we treat the two ND units as with similar detection performances, on-axis, and do not take in account the magnetisation of the gaseous~TPC. 
%Optical partitioning, short electron drift distance, and pixelated readout are features being taken in consideration to %
%improve the performance of the LArTPC to the anticipated high-rate environment %
%and the efficiency of reconstructing events at the near site.

Thanks to its proximity to the accelerator, the ND will be exposed to an extremely intense neutrino beam, %
with a flux peak around five million times greater than at the FD.
The Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) at Fermilab will deploy a very energetic beam of protons, %
extracted from the Main Injector (MI) and delivered to a graphite target.
The collision produces secondary particles, which are collimated by a focusing horn system and then decay forming a neutrino beam.
Assuming an 80\,GeV proton beam at 1.2\,MW for the first six years and at 2.4\,MW for a second set of six years~\cite{Abi:2018dnh}, 
the ND will collect in both neutrino and antineutrino mode a total of \np{2.65e22}\,POT %
over the runtime of the experiment.
In this work we consider only the beam in the neutrino mode configuration, %
which corresponds to half of the total runtime, or \np{1.32e22}\,POT.
The same study of this article can be applied equally to the beam in reversed horn current configuration, %
but its details are not available to us.
Including the analysis for the beam in antineutrino mode should result in an increment on the overall sensitivity, %
approximately a factor of two better.

%Moreover, the ND system could implement the $\nu$PRISM concept~\cite{Bhadra:2014oma}, which would make the detector %
%	movable, to take advantage of the monochromatic nature of the neutrino beam off-axis.

\end{table}

A summary of the features of the ND system is reported in~\reftab{tab:nd}, where it is compared to other beam dump experiments: %
PS191~\cite{Bernardi:1985ny,Bernardi:1987ek}, SBND which is the detector of the SBN programme with the best sensitivity to %
HNL~\cite{Ballett:2016opr}, NA62~\cite{NA62:2017rwk}, and SHiP~\cite{Anelli:2015pba}.
We define the total exposure of the experiment as the proton accelerator beam power, integrated over the total run time, %
and scaled by the volume of the detector over its baseline squared.
The beam power times the run time corresponds to the number of protons on target (POT) times the proton energy. 
With this definition, an exposure twelve times bigger is expected for the DUNE ND system with respect to SBND, %
and around two hundred times bigger than PS191.
The NA62 and SHiP experiments have a different design and are not directly comparable to TPC and tracker experiments, %
but we report them here for thoroughness.
The estimated exposure of NA62 is limited by its number of POT and by just one year of data taking; %
despite this fact, the experiment is optimised to study kaon decays and has good %
sensitivity to HNL~\cite{Drewes:2018irr}.
The SHiP experiment presents an exposure thirty times bigger than DUNE ND, but the detector is specifically %
designed to search for BSM physics, including heavy neutrinos~\cite{SHiP:2018xqw} (see also~\refref{Caputo:2016ojx}).
The decay-in-flight search hugely benefits from its 50\,m long decay vessel and short baseline.

On the collider physics frontier, the FASER experiment~\cite{Ariga:2018uku} will perform a dedicated search for %
extremely weakly-interacting particles, like HNLs for which it presents interesting sensitivity~\cite{Kling:2018wct}.
The detector consists of a 10\,m cylindrical decay volume located 480\,m downstream of the ATLAS interaction point.

	\label{fig:fluxes}
\end{figure}

%A powerful proton beam is responsible for the very intense neutrino flux at the LBNF facility.
In order to implement our analysis, the various components of the flux by parentage must be known separately.
We study only the beam operating with a forward horn current, which selects %
positively charged secondary particles and results in a beam dominantly made of neutrinos %
with a smaller component of antineutrinos.
%
The flux predictions for $\nu_e$, $\nu_\mu$, and $\cj{\nu}_\mu$, provided by \refref{LauraFields} for the reference beam, %
are shown in~\reffig{fig:fluxes} subdivided in their parent components.
The $\nu_\mu$ flux is the dominant component and is principally originated %
by pion decays, whilst its long tail comes from kaon decays.
Unsuccessfully deflected negative particles, like $\pi^-$ or $K^-$, and the $\mu^+$ are the main contributors %
to the $\cj{\nu}_\mu$ components, and $\nu_e$ comes predominately from the muon %
and both $K^+$ and $K^0$ decays.
We consider only the energy range $E < 20\,\text{GeV}$, because it is the most intense region of the flux %
and, as it will be explained in~\refsec{sec:numevt}, the most relevant for this study.

	\label{fig:taudist}
\end{figure}

We highlight here the fact that we expect also an albeit-small flux of HNLs with masses above the kaon one.
This could be inferred from the $\nu_\tau$ flux, but this is not available in the literature.
In fact, the lightest meson with an interesting decay width to tau neutrinos is the charmed-strange meson~$D_s^+$, %
which has a mass $m_{D_s} = \np{1968.34}\pm\np{0.07}$\,MeV~\cite{PDG}.
It~decays into $\tau^+ \nu_\tau$ with a branching ratio of $\np{5.48}\pm\np{0.23}$\,\%.
HNL with masses above the $K^0$ can be produced via the tau mixing, but more importantly via %
the muonic and electronic ones which are enhanced, as shown in \refsec{sec:production}.
The meson $D^+$ also decays into $\tau^+ \nu_\tau$, but being lighter than the $D_s^+$, %
the decay is disfavoured by the smaller phase space, with a branching ratio~50 times smaller.
This meson presents three-body decay channels into $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu$ with much higher branching ratio, %
but there is no enhancement for such channels into HNL, as explained in \refsec{sec:production}, and so these subdominant components %
are not taken in account in the present study.

%However, HNL with masses above the $K^0$ mass can only be produced by the decays of $D^+$ and $D_s^+$, %
%and the production of massive neutrinos could be enhanced, especially if produced via the $|U_{e 4}|^2$ mixing.
%{\color{red} What about the decay of $D^+$?? The considerations of it being disfavoured because of phase space would not apply to decay into N and muons or N and electron, which are enhanced compared to the standard case.}
%We make an estimate of the $\nu_\tau$ spectrum, starting from the $D_s^+$ production by %
%an 80\,GeV proton beam hitting a fixed graphite target.
The proton beam has a relatively low energy for producing charm quarks with a high cross-section, %
so the prediction of $\nu_\tau$ has not been carried out by the collaboration to the best of our knowledge.
For the reasons stated above, we make a prediction for the $D_s^+$ production by %
an 80\,GeV proton beam hitting a fixed graphite target.
The distribution at the production site will be then used to estimate the $\nu_\tau$ flux at the ND system.
In the literature, the following parametrisation has been successfully used to describe %
the charm meson production in proton-proton collision in the Centre of Mass frame~\cite{Ammar:1988ta}
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:dsflux}
	\frac{\dd[2]{\sigma}}{\dd{x_F}\dd{p_T^2}} \sim (1-|x_F|)^n e^{-b p_T^2}~,
\end{equation}
where $x_F = 2 p_z/\sqrt{s}$, with $p_z$ the longitudinal momentum in the CM frame. %
The parameters $n$ and $b$ were fitted from the E769 experiment and found to be %
$n = \np{6.1}\pm\np{0.7}$ and \mbox{$b = \np{1.08}\pm\np{0.09}$}~\cite{Alves:1996qz}.
We assume that the $D_s^+$ meson production at the target follows the same distribution.
With the help of a Monte Carlo simulation, we generate the $D_s^+$ four-momenta starting from~\refeq{eq:dsflux} %
and simulate the meson decay and the subsequent tau decays.
A key simplification here is that because of the short lifetime of the $D_s^+$ and $\tau^+$, %
of the order of \np{e-13}\,s, their path is not affected by the horn system nor by interactions with other accelerator components. 
This results in no focusing of these secondary particles, and so only neutrinos emitted %
within the geometric acceptance of the ND are considered to form the $\nu_\tau$ and $\cj{\nu}_\tau$ spectrum.
The overall normalisation comes from an open charm calculation (see~\refapp{sec:opencc} for details): %
the number of $D_s^+$ per POT is found to be $(2.8 \pm 0.2) \times \np{e-6}$.
The result of the simulation is reported in the bottom right panel of~\reffig{fig:fluxes}, %
where the different contributions to the $\nu_\tau$ spectrum are shown.
Thanks to the large number of POTs in DUNE, the total number of $D_s^+$ mesons produced is comparable %
to other dedicated experiments~\cite{Alekhin:2015byh}; %
however, the beamline design is not optimised for heavy mesons production %
and the $\nu_\tau$ flux seen at the ND is strongly attenuated.%: %
%according to our simulation, only \np{0.13}\,\% of the neutrinos produced at the target reaches the ND.

Having knowledge of the parent meson distribution, we directly simulate the production of nearly-sterile neutrinos %
from the $D_s$ decays.
The spectrum of heavy neutrinos is distorted when their mass approaches the various phase space thresholds, %
which appears as a further enhancement of the flux. 
This is because heavier neutrinos are more easily boosted inside the geometric acceptance of the detector.
Besides the peak height, the start and the end point of the energy flux are also affected,
as illustrated in~\reffig{fig:taudist}. 
We take these effects in account, modifying the scaled neutrino flux using information retrieved by the $\nu_\tau$ and $\cj{\nu}_\tau$~simulation. 

\subsection{Background evaluation}
\label{sec:background}

%The major source of noise comes from ordinary neutrino-nucleon interactions happening within the fiducial volume of the detector.
%As shown in~\reftab{tab:rate}, the ND will expect a copious number of CC and NC events. %, usually categorised as: %
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Charged Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) interactions whether a charged lepton is present in the final state, %
%		revealing the flavour state of the incoming neutrino;
%	\item Neutral Current Elastic (NCE) scatterings if there is no charged lepton;
%	\item CC resonant pion production (CC1$\pi$) when a pion is also emitted;
%	\item NC resonant pion production (NC1$\pi$) if it is mediated by neutral currents;
%	\item Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) which classifies all interaction happening at high energy and with high level %
%	of hadronization.

The number of SM neutrino--nucleon interactions expected at the DUNE ND, without considering detector effects, is calculated %
by integrating the Charged Current (CC) and Neutral Current (NC) total cross sections multiplied %
by the light neutrino spectrum~$\dv*{\phi_\nu}{E}$:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:numev}
	\mathcal{N}_\text{tot} = \mathcal{N}_\text{CC} + \mathcal{N}_\text{NC} = 
	\mathcal{N}_\text{target} \int \dd{E} \qty[\sigma_\text{CC}(E) + \sigma_\text{NC}(E)] \, \dv{\phi_\nu}{E}\ ,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_\text{CC}(E)$ and $\sigma_\text{NC}(E)$ are the cross section predictions in argon %
calculated with \mbox{\textsc{genie}}~\cite{Andreopoulos:2009rq}, and $\mathcal{N}_\text{target}$ is the %
total number of Ar targets. 
The event rates are shown in~\reftab{tab:rate}.
It turns out that less than one $\nu_\tau$ event is expected in the total run of the experiment.
As~a~comparison, the number of $\nu_\mu$ events will be \np{e10} times higher.
This confirms the expectations that the $\nu_\tau$ component of the flux is negligible %
for standard oscillation physics in~DUNE ND.
On the other hand $\nu_\tau$ appearance is expected at the FD.


%%%% START EDIT

These neutrino scatterings occurring within the fiducial volume of the detector could mimic %
the rare signal of neutrino in-flight decays, as some final state particles are common to both processes.
A good estimate of the number of possible background events for each discovery channel is very important, %
since it dictates the true sensitivity of the experiment.
We restrict our conservative background analysis to decay modes available for neutrino masses below $m_{K^0}$, %
being these the channels with the best discovery potential.
They are $N\to\nu e^+ e^-$, $\nu e^\pm \mu^\mp$, $\nu \mu^+ \mu^-$, $\nu \pi^0$, $e^\mp \pi^\pm$, and $\mu^\mp \pi^\pm$.
%
Particles are typically tagged by studying the topology of the tracks and the energy loss $\dv*{E}{x}$ in the active medium, %
but instead of dealing with a full detector simulation, we perform a fast Monte Carlo analysis, %
using as input neutrino--nucleon scattering events in argon generated by the neutrino event generator \textsc{genie}~\cite{Andreopoulos:2009rq}.
The tracks are randomly placed inside the ND system and then smeared according to a normal distribution centred on the simulated value of energy/momentum; %
particles with a kinetic energy above the detection threshold are then assumed to be reconstructed.
%
The relative position between the two detectors is taken into account, in that %
particle tracks exiting the LArTPC end entering the FGT are reconstructed as a single track.
Escaping or partially reconstructed tracks are not discarded, but treated with a different energy/momentum resolution: %
the initial particle energy can be estimated, with some limitations, thanks to the energy dependence of the mean energy loss %
during the particle propagation.
We then implement possible sources of background mis-identification which are channel specific.
Detector resolutions and thresholds, from~\refref{Alion:2016uaj} for both parts of the ND, are summarised in~\reftab{tab:fastmc}.

%
A strong discriminant for background events is the presence of protons, neutrons, and other hadrons in the final states, %
which are the results of the nucleus recoil of the neutrino interaction.
%If the nucleon or nucleus recoil in a neutrino-nucleon interaction can be identified, %
If hadronic activity is reconstructed as an interaction vertex, then the event is clearly originated by %
SM neutrino--nucleon scattering and tagged as background.
In the case this does not happen, for instance when the hadrons are below threshold, the multiplicity of final state particles %
becomes fundamental to distinguish signal events from intrinsic background.
However, this background can be worsened by mis-identification of certain tracks.

The main background to the pseudo-scalar meson channels, $N\to \ell^\mp \pi^\pm$, are resonance $\nu_e$ or $\nu_\mu$--CC %
interaction with single pion production or incoherent and deep inelastic scatterings in which only a pair $\ell\,\pi$ is detected.
Three-body lepton decays suffers from mis-identification of additional pions and photons emitted in CC neutrino scatterings %
which are mistaken for charged leptons.
Despite having a similar mass, pion and muon tracks differ on average in length, as the meson track often culminates in a hadronic shower.
In~our implementation of the detector effects, if no hadronic shower is detected and the track length is longer than two metres, %
the pion is identified as a muon.
Electromagnetic shower induced by photons are identified by looking at the vertex displacement and at the $\dv*{E}{x}$, %
which is twice as large as the energy loss for $e^\pm$.
If a photon converts within two centimetres from the interaction point, and either the electron or the positron of the pair is below threshold, %
the photon is reconstructed as a single electron.
%assuming the other electron of the pair doesn't shower or is below threshold.
A pair of electrons with a small separation angle, less than 3\textdegree, is tagged as an electron-positron pair %
and the parent photon is reconstructed.
The main source of photons comes from the decay of the neutral pion, which is abundantly produced in neutrino--nucleon interactions.
Certain hadronic transitions from secondary particles of deep inelastic scatterings also emit gammas.
If a pair of photons shows an invariant mass comparable with the $\pi^0$ mass, the parent pion is identified.
Interactions in which multiple neutral pions are produced, but only a pair of photons is detected and reconstructed, %
can be background to the $N\to \nu \pi^0$ channel.
The~background events surviving particle identification are between 5\,\% down to 0.01\,\% of the processed events, %
the rejection of which strongly depends on the analysed channel.

%A million neutrino-nucleon events in argon is generated using the neutrino event generator \textsc{genie}~\cite{Andreopoulos:2009rq} %
%and then smeared according to a normal distribution centred on the simulated value of energy/momentum: %
%%{\color{red} true value of what? energy??} %
%particles with a kinetic energy above the detection threshold are assumed to be reconstructed.
%We use the same resolutions and thresholds from~\refref{Alion:2016uaj} for both parts of the ND.
%These are summarised in~\reftab{tab:fastmc}.
%We then implement detector geometry effects and possible sources of misidentification.
%{\color{red} but wouldn't it appear as 2 electrons???} 
%Likewise, if a pair of photons shows an invariant mass comparable with the $\pi^0$ mass, %
%the parent pion is identified.
%{color{red} WHAT DO WE MEAN WITH THIS????? Relying solely on particle counting,} the background is reduced by at least a factor of $\sim$10 %
%and up to a factor of $\sim\np{e4}$.

The channels which open up for masses above the kaon mass are more challenging from an experimental point of view.
The final state particles of these modes are mostly neutral pseudo-scalar mesons, which decay electromagnetically, %
or vector mesons, which usually decay into a multi-state of lighter mesons, depending on the initial flavour content,
sometimes accompanied by photon emission.
The correct identification of these short-lived states is non trivial.
For very high masses, also $\tau$ leptons are yielded, but their precise reconstruction requires \emph{ad hoc} techniques.
These tasks are beyond the scope of the analysis presented here and are best left to the collaboration superior simulation tools.
We also do not consider cosmogenic background, even though a rate of \np{2.7}\,Hz/m\tapi{2} cosmic rays %
is expected at the ND hall~\cite{Sinclair:DUNEdoc}, which has very little over burden.
Given an area of a few square meters, the number of cosmic rays per drift window can be non-negligible~\cite{Abi:2018dnh}, %
but rejection techniques are being developed with good signal efficiencies~\cite{Adams:2018lzd}.

Except for $N$ decaying into three neutrinos, all the other decay channels are in principle detectable.
%Some decay modes contribute more significantly to the physics reach thanks to larger branching ratios and lower backgrounds.
%Along with the number of background events, a correct estimation of the number of decays in the visible channels %
%is necessary in order to evaluate the sensitivity of DUNE ND to the discovery of HNL.
%It is therefore fundamental to estimate the number of possible background events $\mathcal{B}_d$ for each channel $d$, %
For a given visible decay mode~$d$, the number of signal events is
%The expected number of heavy neutrino decays inside the detector for a given decay channel~$d$ %
%can be estimated with the following formula:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:event}
	\mathcal{N}_d = \int\!\! \dd{E}\ \Pi_d(E) W_d(E)\, \dv{\phi_N}{E}\ ,
\end{equation}
where $\dv*{\phi_N}{E}$ is the number of heavy neutrinos expected at the ND, %
computed in the way described in~\refsec{sec:production}.
The function $\Pi_d(E)$ accounts for the probability of a heavy neutrino of energy $E$ to decay inside the ND after covering the baseline distance $L$.
It is expressed in the following form:
\begin{equation}
	\Pi_d(E) = e^{-\frac{\Gamma_\text{tot} L}{\gamma \beta}} %
	\qty(1-e^{-\frac{\Gamma_\text{tot} \lambda}{\gamma \beta}}) \frac{\Gamma_d}{\Gamma_\text{tot}}\ , 
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the length of the ND, $\Gamma_d$ the decay rate for the channel $d$ and %
$\Gamma_\text{tot}$ the total decay rate.
The total effect of $\Pi_d$ is to favour low-energy bins of the neutrino spectrum for which the %
relativistic factor $\gamma\beta$ is small.

The term $W_d(E)$ is a signal efficiency factor, estimated as the binned ratio of the true $N$ energy spectrum after %
and before a background rejection procedure.
The latter is a process aiming to further reduce the number of background events still present after particle identification.
It consists of simple data selection cuts optimised to reject the background while minimising the loss of signal events, %
exploiting differences in the energy and angular distributions of signal and background events.
The HNL decays inside the detector are simulated by a custom Monte Carlo code and the tracks are processed in the same way %
as it is done for background events (see~\refsec{sec:background}).
The resulting signal efficiency therefore embeds also detector effects.
If no background is expected for the channel $d$, there is no need for applying any rejection procedure %
and so the signal efficiency is maximal, i.e.\ $W_d(E) = 1$ at all energies.
The final number of background events $\mathcal{B}_d$ and the number of signal events $\mathcal{N}_d$ are %
eventually used to build the Confidence Level (C.L.) regions of sensitivity (see \refsec{sec:results}).
%
%The term $W_d(E)$ is a weighting factor given by the binned ratio of the true $N$ energy spectrum after %
%and before the background reduction procedure.
%{\color{red} We discuss the backgrounds in the previous section. Why this stuff is here?} The latter process aims to further reduce the number of background events, still present after particle identification.
%It consists of simple data selection cuts optimised to reject the background while maintaining a high signal efficiency, %
%exploiting differences in the distributions of signal and background events.
%In general terms, background events are expected to have a more isotropic angular distribution %
%compared to decay-in-flight which are very boosted forward.	
%Signal events are generated with a custom Monte Carlo code and are processed in the same manner as the background events (see~\refsec{sec:background}).
%{\color{red} THE FOLLOWING IS NOT CLEAR In this way, the final weighting factor is the result of not only data selection cuts, but also detector effects.
%	If no background is expected before the event rejection process, then these factors are maximal, i.e.\ $W_d(E) = 1$ %
%	at all energies.
%	IS THAT SO?????? THE FOLLOWING IS NOT CLEAR EITHER. The final number of background events $\mathcal{B}_d$ is eventually used to define the Confidence Level (C.L.) regions of sensitivity.}
We leave a more detailed discussion on the background reduction cuts in~\refapp{sec:appbackground}, %
where we report the rates of background reduction and signal selection for all decay channels of both Majorana and Dirac neutrinos of a given mass.
We note that the Dirac neutrino decays generally have a lower signal efficiency, between 5\% and 10\% less, %
compared to a Majorana state of the same mass.
%All decay rates not listed above are forbidden for a Dirac (anti-)particle as the combination of production and decay would amount to a LNV process.
This is a consequence of certain combinations of production and decay modes which are forbidden for Dirac neutrinos, %
as they would lead to LNV.
The final true energy distributions of Majorana and Dirac neutrinos can therefore be different.
When looking at the NC decay $N\to\nu \pi^0$, the difference in signal efficiency is almost recovered, %
thanks to the angular dependence of Dirac neutrino decays which makes it more distinguishable from background.

%This is a consequence of the different angular distribution between Majorana and Dirac neutrino decays.
%Because we are not taking in account charge identification in our analysis, Majorana neutrino decays are isotropic in the CM.
%{\color{red} THIS IS NOT CLEAR. In the case of Dirac neutrinos, there is a forward-backward asymmetry resulting from the unbalanced components of neutrinos and antineutrinos in the beam.
%	The difference in the angular distributions is slightly reflected in the laboratory frame and hence the signal efficiency can be affected.}

%	This can be seen as the limit in which the size of the detector $\lambda$ is %
%	greater than the decay length of the Majorana neutrino, $\beta \gamma\ \Gamma_\text{tot}^{\np{-1}}$, %
%	and the probability is approximated by
%	\begin{equation}
%		\Pi_d(E) \simeq e^{-\frac{\Gamma_\text{tot} L}{\gamma \beta}} \frac{\Gamma_d}{\Gamma_\text{tot}}\ .
%	\end{equation}
%	In this regime the event rate does not dependent on the detector size, as heavy neutrinos decay within a few %
%	decay lengths.

%The number of signal events is then compared to the expected number of background events.
%For a specific channel $d$, the probability of observing $n$ events with a signal mean $\sigma = \mathcal{N}_d$ %
%and background $b = \mathcal{B}_d$ follows a Poisson distribution:
%\begin{equation*}
%	P(n|\sigma,b) = (\sigma+b) \frac{e^{-(\sigma+b)}}{n!}\ .
%\end{equation*}
%The null hypothesis $H_0$ is that no sterile neutrino decays are seen ($\sigma = 0$), %
%while only background events $b$ are expected.
%We employ the Feldman and Cousins method~\cite{Feldman:1997qc} to estimate the number of events needed in order %
%to reject $H_0$ with the desired confidence level.
%For example, if no background is expected ($W_d = 1$), an average of $n = 2.44$ events %
%must be detected to reject $H_0$ with 90\,\% C.L.
%This criterion is used to define the sensitivity regions shown in~\refsec{sec:results} and~\ref{sec:combined}.



\section{Sensitivities of DUNE ND}
\label{sec:results}

We present here sensitivity regions for the discovery of heavy neutrino decays for %
a total amount of \np{1.32e22}\,POT collected with the beam in neutrino mode.
All the regions are estimated at the 90\,\% C.L.\ in rejecting the null hypothesis, %
by which no HNL decays are seen ($\sigma = 0$), but only background events $b$ are expected.
For a specific channel~$d$, the probability of observing $n$ events with a signal mean $\sigma = \mathcal{N}_d$ %
and background $b = \mathcal{B}_d$ (see~\refsec{sec:numevt}) follows a Poisson distribution
\begin{equation*}
	P(n|\sigma,b) = (\sigma+b) \frac{e^{-(\sigma+b)}}{n!}\ .
\end{equation*}
We employ the Feldman and Cousins method~\cite{Feldman:1997qc} to estimate the number of events needed in order %
to reject $H_0$ at the desired C.L..
For example, if no background is expected \mbox{($W_d = 1$)}, an average of $n = 2.44$ events %
must be detected to reject $H_0$ with 90\,\% C.L.\ 
This~criterion is used to define the sensitivity regions shown in this section, for both Majorana and Dirac neutrinos.
It is found in every case that the MPD alone has a better sensitivity than the LArTPC, %
thanks not only to a larger volume, but also to a less dense medium which gives lower backgrounds.
As the two modules are assumed to have the same detection performance, we present here a combined analysis of the %
two detectors, taking into account particle propagation between them.	
We do not consider charged identification capabilities of the ND, and therefore this information is washed out %
in presenting the sensitivity plots in this and next sections.
Because of our charge-blind analysis, the number of events expected for Majorana neutrinos is twice as large as %
the number in the case of Dirac neutrinos, therefore the sensitivity to Dirac neutrino decays is %
a factor of two worse than the Majorana case.
The limits reported here below refer to Majorana heavy neutrinos; the corresponding limit for which $N$ is a Dirac fermion %
is easily retrieved by doubling the upper limit.

In~\refsec{sec:dominant}, we show the constraint that DUNE ND can place on a simplified scenario %
in which a single mixing matrix element between HNL and active neutrinos dominates.
We~have also considered a scenario in which two mixings are dominant with respect to the third one, %
the results of which are presented in~\refsec{sec:bimax}.
%Finally, we make a comparison of this analysis with previous and recent results of beam dump experiment.
%and explain the how the experiment %
%can explore the parameter spaces of different neutrino mass models in the next section, \ref{sec:combined}.

	\label{fig:senseW}
\end{figure}

In this section, we present the sensitivity regions for the three mixings $|U_{e N}|^2$, $|U_{\mu N}|^2$, and %
$|U_{\tau N}|^2$, where we assume that just one mixing element dominates over the other two.
The~sensitivities for the decay channels $N\to\nu e^+ e^-$, $\nu e^\pm \mu^\mp$, $\nu \mu^+ \mu^-$, $\nu \pi^0$, % 
$e^\mp \pi^\pm$ ($|U_{e N}|^2$ only), and $\mu^\mp \pi^\pm$ ($|U_{\mu N}|^2$ only) are reported in \reffig{fig:senseW}.
The solid lines corresponds to a scenario in which zero background is assumed at the ND.
%The introduction of background worsens the sensitives, the lines of which are represented by dashed lines.
A background study is done for these channels (see~\refsec{sec:background}), to outline a more realistic sensitivity; %
the resulting regions are shown as dashed lines in \reffig{fig:senseW}.
As we expect that further improvements to background reduction can be achieved with a dedicated analysis by the experimental collaboration,
the final sensitivity will lie somewhere between the lines with and without backgrounds.

For both the electronic and the muonic mixings, the two-body semi-leptonic decay modes are the ones providing %
the best sensitivity for sufficiently heavy masses.
With the channel $N\to e^\mp \pi^\pm$, the mixing can be constrained in the range $0.15\,\text{GeV} \lesssim m_N \lesssim 0.49\,\text{GeV}$ %
to be $|U_{e N}|^2 < \np{3e-9}$, with a minimum point $|U_{e N}|^2 < \np{7e-11}$ at $m_N \simeq 0.39$\,GeV.
Including the background rejection, the limits are loosened by a factor of $\sim$3.5.
The~channel $N\to \mu^\mp \pi^\pm$ can constrain the mixing $|U_{\mu N}|^2 < \np{5.6e-10}$ %
in the mass range \mbox{$0.25\,\text{GeV} \lesssim m_N \lesssim 0.39\,\text{GeV}$}, with the best limit $|U_{\mu N}|^2 < \np{1.3e-10}$ %
at $m_N \simeq 0.35$\,GeV.
In this case, the higher background and the worse signal efficiency reduce the bound up to a factor of $\sim$5.6.
The NC decay $N\to \nu \pi^0$ is the channel most affected by background and with the worst signal efficiency: %
the limits are higher by a factor of~$\sim$9.0 for the electronic, $\sim$8.2 for the muonic, and~$\sim$11.7 for the tau mixing.
Assuming no background, instead, the constrains placed by this decay mode can be competitive, as the %
mixings are limited at best for $m_N \simeq 0.35$\,GeV to be $|U_{e N}|^2 < \np{1.1e-10}$ and %
$|U_{\mu N}|^2 < \np{1.6e-10}$, and $|U_{\tau N}|^2 < \np{5e-7}$ between $0.9\,\text{GeV} \lesssim m_N \lesssim 1.3\,\text{GeV}$.
%This difference is due to the fact that charge-ID is not taken in account in our analysis.
There is no sensitivity to the channel $N\to\tau^\mp\pi^\pm$ because of the subdominant branching ratio %
and flux content.

The three-body lepton decays have a lower reach, but are more sensitive to masses above the kaon mass limit %
than the two-body semi-leptonic modes.
The channel $N\to \nu e^- e^+$ is the only one that covers the whole mass range of interest and is the least affected by background reduction, %
with a factor less than 3.
It can limit the electronic mixing down to $|U_{e N}|^2 < \np{2.6e-9}$ at $m_N \simeq 0.11$\,GeV, %
$|U_{e N}|^2 < \np{3.0e-10}$ at $m_N \simeq 0.39$\,GeV, and $|U_{e N}|^2 < \np{3.0e-9}$ at $m_N \simeq 1.6$\,GeV.
The channels $N \to\nu \mu^- \mu^+$ and $\nu e^\pm \mu^\mp$, perform better with the muon mixing, %
despite suffering more from background rejection, between a factor of 8 for the muon mixing and up to a factor of 15 %
for the tau mixing.
They respectively give the limits %
$|U_{\mu N}|^2 < \np{9.2e-10}$ at $m_N \simeq 0.37$\,GeV and $|U_{\mu N}|^2 < \np{8.7e-8}$ at $m_N \simeq 1.5$\,GeV, and %
$|U_{\mu N}|^2 < \np{4.8e-10}$ at $m_N \simeq 0.36$\,GeV and $|U_{\mu N}|^2 < \np{6.4e-8}$ at $m_N \simeq 1.6$\,GeV.
The $\tau$ sector can only be constrained by the two NC--mediated channels, which give very similar constraints near $m_N\simeq 1$\,GeV, %
these being both $|U_{\tau N}|^2 < \np{1.2e-6}$.

%These regions are naturally weakened when the background analysis is taken in account.
%Instead of performing an event simulation for each value of the heavy neutrino mass, %
%we study the background expectancy only for 9 equally-spaced choices of heavy neutrino mass from 50 MeV to 450 MeV and we interpolate in between.
%%
%	%The weighting factors $W_d$ explained in section~\ref{sec:numevt} are extrapolated in the same manner.
%The channels less afflicted from background reduction analysis are the decays $N\to \ell_\alpha^- \pi^+$, %
%$N\to \nu e^-e^+$, and $N\to \nu e^\mp\mu^\pm$, the sensitivities of which are reduced by less than a factor of 10.
%The other channels present more background and the reduction in the sensitivity is slightly more than one order of magnitude.
%No background analysis is made for masses above the kaon mass.

A background study was not performed for all the other decay channels, which open up for masses above the $K^0$ mass, %
due to the fact that the final state particles need a more complex analysis.
The sensitivities to these modes are shown in~\reffig{fig:senseV}, and they can place some constraints to the mixing.
All the channels peak in their sensitivity for masses between $1.3$ and $1.8$\,GeV.
The best limits obtained for CC decays are %
$|U_{e N}|^2 < \np{2.3e-9}$ from $N \to e^\mp \rho^\pm$ and $|U_{\mu N}|^2 < \np{6.2e-8}$ from $N \to \mu^\mp \rho^\pm$; %
among the NC decays $|U_{e N}|^2 < \np{3.7e-9}$ and $|U_{\mu N}|^2 < \np{1.0e-7}$ both from $N \to \nu \phi$.
Even for these channels, there is no sensitivity to CC processes to the tau mixing, %
but interesting limits are set from $N\to \nu\omega$, $\nu\rho^0$ to be respectively %
$|U_{\tau N}|^2 < \np{1.8e-6}$, $\np{8.8e-7}$.

	\label{fig:senseMix}
\end{figure}

In this section we present the bounds in a scenario in which two mixing elements are comparable and dominant over the third one.
This case complements the previous analysis in \refsec{sec:dominant} as, by searching for HNL decays, %
the experiment can constrain certain combinations of the mixing elements.
This can happen when the neutrino is produced via one mixing and decays via another one, %
or when both mixing elements play a role in production and decay.
For instance, the decay $K^+ \to \mu^+ N$ yields heavy neutrinos with a flux proportional to %
$|U_{\mu N}|^2$, but they can afterwards decay into the channel $\nu e^+ e^-$ also via the electronic or the tau mixing.
It is important to highlight that, in the case in which one mixing is responsible for the production and a different mixing for the decay, %
then number of events is proportional to the product of the mixings $|U_{\alpha N}||U_{\beta N}|$ if the studied channel is CC--mediated.
However, if the decay channel is also sensitive to a NC exchange, the number of events is instead proportional to %
$|U_{\alpha N}|\sqrt{|U_{\alpha N}|^2 + |U_{\beta N}|^2}$.
In the remainder of this section, we will use the combination of two mixings represented by $|U_{\alpha N}^* U_{\beta N}|$ %
\enlargethispage{\baselineskip}
for comparing bounds and sensitivity plots.

%However, if two mixings are non-zero, nothing prevents the production and the decay to be mediated by both of them. 
The combinations of mixing terms is relevant to charged Lepton Flavour Violating (cLFV) decays or flavour changing neutral current processes %
which can be enhanced in presence of nearly-sterile neutrinos.
For example, the well-known decay $\mu^+ \to e^+ \gamma$ has a branching ratio which is sensitive to extra neutrino states.
This reads
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:meg}
	\text{Br}(\mu^+ \to e^+ \gamma) = \frac{3 \alpha}{32 \pi} \abs{\sum_i \hat{U}_{\mu i}^*\, \hat{U}_{e i}\,G\qty(\frac{m_i^2}{M_W^2})} \ ,
\end{equation}
where $G(x)$ is the loop function of the process~\cite{Ilakovac:1994kj}.
The current upper limit is set by the MEG experiment to be $\text{Br}(\mu^+ \to e^+\gamma) < \np{4.2e-13}$~\cite{TheMEG:2016wtm}.
Despite being one of the best constrained cLFV process, the bounds on $|U_{e N}^* U_{\mu N}|$ are not as good as the ones imposed %
by other processes, like $\mu \to e e e$ or $\mu - e$ conversion on nuclei~\cite{Alonso:2012ji}.
For instance, the constraint from conversion on Au is $|U_{e N}^* U_{\mu N}| < \np{1.6e-5}$ %
for HNL masses larger than 100\,MeV~\cite{Deshpande:2011uv}.
The branching ratio of other cLFV channels, like $\tau \to e \gamma$ or $\tau \to \mu \gamma$ are not as well constrained %
and so the bounds achievable on the combination of heavy neutrino mixings are expected to be less %
stringent~\cite{Buras:2010cp, Abada:2016vzu}.
Stronger bounds come from study of three-body decays of charm and bottom mesons to charged leptons with different flavour %
and tau decays to pseudo-scalar mesons and a charged lepton: from the search for %
the decay $K \to e \mu \pi$ the bound $|U_{e N}^* U_{\mu N}| < \np{e-9}$ is reached for masses $150\,\text{MeV}\lesssim m_N \lesssim 500\,\text{MeV}$;
%\enlargethispage{\baselineskip}
the decays $\tau \to e \pi \pi$ and $\tau \to \mu \pi\pi$ set the limits
$|U_{e N}^* U_{\tau N}|, |U_{\mu N}^* U_{\tau N}| < \np{5e-6}$ for the respective mass ranges $0.14\,\text{GeV}\lesssim m_N \lesssim 1.7\,\text{GeV}$ and %
$0.24\,\text{GeV}\lesssim m_N \lesssim 1.7\,\text{GeV}$~\cite{Helo:2010cw}.



Instead of dealing with a three-dimensional parameter scan, we simplify the study %
by assigning the same value to the two mixing parameters under consideration.
The number of events is then reported as a function of the neutrino mass and the combination $|U_{\alpha N}^* U_{\beta N}|$.
The results for all channels considered in this work are shown in~\reffig{fig:senseMix}.
The best constraints come again from two-body semi-leptonic decays for all mixing combinations, %
the lowest upper limits being $|U_{e N}^* U_{\mu N}| < \np{6.3e-11}$ at $m_N \simeq 0.37$\,GeV, %
$|U_{\mu N}^* U_{\tau N}| < \np{1.1e-10}$ at $m_N \simeq 0.35$\,GeV, and $|U_{\tau N}^* U_{e N}| < \np{7.4e-11}$ at $m_N \simeq 0.39$\,GeV.
Amongst the three-body leptonic decay channels, $N\to\nu e e$ has the best sensitivity to masses $m_N < m_{K^0}$, %
but actually the mode $N\to \nu e^\mp \mu^\pm$ can be more constraining at higher masses.
Regarding the channels available only above the kaon mass threshold, decays to pseudo-scalar mesons are the most sensitive %
between C processes, whereas the decay $N \to \nu \phi$ gives the best constraint of the NC--mediated channels.
\section{Mass model constraints from DUNE ND}
\label{sec:combined}

%Finally, we make a comparison of this analysis with previous and recent results of beam dump experiment.
%and explain the how the experiment %
%can explore the parameter spaces of different neutrino mass models in the next section, \ref{sec:combined}.

From the results presented in the previous section, we find that the DUNE ND will be sensitive to very low couplings %
for experimentally accessible mass values.
These points of the parameter space corresponds to regions viable in some realisations of low scale neutrino mass models.
In view of the discussion regarding seesaw models in \refsec{sec:model}, we perform a mass matrix random scan to %
define such regions of the parameter space.
Following the previously introduced notation, we focus on three minimal ISS scenarios which predict a HNL with a mass accessible %
by the experiment and that satisfy the experimental evidence of neutrino oscillation~\cite{Abada:2014vea}.
In the first two cases, the heavy neutrino under study belongs to the lightest pseudo-Dirac pair %
of an ISS\,(2,2) and an ISS\,(2,3) realisation; the third scenario is an ISS\,(2,3) case %
in which the fourth Weyl state becomes a Majorana neutrino in the \mbox{MeV--GeV} region thanks to a high LNV parameter.
The details of this analysis are reported in this section, together with the overall sensitivities of DUNE ND to %
heavy neutrino discovery and low scale mass models. 
A comparison with future experiments is also included.

\subsection{Mass model scan}

%The DUNE experiment will be very sensitive to regions of the parameter space of interest with respect to low scale seesaw models.
We have randomly generated neutrino mass matrices and numerically diagonalised them.
The structure of the mass matrix is a generalised version of an ISS:
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{M} = 
	\begin{pmatrix}
		0	& m_D^T	& 0	\\
		m_D	& \mu_R	& M^T_R	\\
		0	& M_R	& \mu_S
	\end{pmatrix}\ ,
\end{equation}
with two LNV submatrices, $\mu_R$ and $\mu_S$.
The number of physical parameters of a ISS\,$(a,b)$ mass matrix is $n_p = 7a + b +2 a\,b$~\cite{Abada:2014vea}. %
We choose a basis in which $m_D$ has complex entries but three of which are real, $M_R$ is diagonal and real, and $\mu_S$ has a real diagonal %
without loss of generality.
If the matrix entries respect the hierarchy \mbox{$\mu_{R,S} \ll m_D \ll M_R$}, the mass spectrum in %
the LNC limit is principally given by the diagonal values of $M_R$.
We then perturb the matrix to achieve the three minimal ISS scenarios introduced above; %
the randomly generated mass matrix $\mathcal{M}$ %
is then diagonalised using the Jacobi Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as implemented in the Eigen library~\cite{Eigen:2010}.
The Takagi decomposition, %
\begin{equation*}
	\hat{U}^T \mathcal{M}\, \hat{U} = \text{diag}(m_1, m_2, m_3, ...)\ ,
\end{equation*}
is retrieved starting from the SVD decomposition $\mathcal{M} = V \Sigma U^\dagger$, %
from which the singular values $\Sigma$ are the non-negative square roots of the eigenvalues of $\mathcal{M}^\dagger \mathcal{M}$ %
and the unitary matrix is $\hat{U} = U \rho^\dagger$, where $\rho = (U^T V)^\frac{1}{2}$ is a unitary phase matrix.

Only matrices satisfying the current constraints on heavy neutral fermions are taken in account.
The first requirement is that the eigenvalues must give the correct mass squared splittings %
compatible within 3$\sigma$ with the measured values~\cite{nufit}.
The condition of matching also the measured mixing angles is relaxed because %
the entries of the PMNS matrix, $\mathcal{U}$, are the result of the random structure of $m_D$ and $\mu_S$.
Constraints on the unitarity of the mixing matrix are applied instead.
The deviation from unitarity are quantified by the following Hermitian matrix:
\begin{equation}
	\varepsilon_{\alpha \beta} \equiv |\delta_{\alpha \beta} - (\mathcal{U}\,\mathcal{U}^\dagger)_{\alpha \beta}| = %
	\abs{\sum_{i=4}^n \hat{U}_{\alpha i} \hat{U}_{\beta i}^*}\ .
\end{equation}
The non-unitarity of the PMNS matrix has been assessed in various experiments, and the constraints depend upon the mass scale of averaged out neutrinos.
For neutrino masses below the GeV scale, but heavy enough to decouple from flavour oscillations, %
non-unitarity effects are tested in neutrino oscillation experiment as an overall normalisation.
If the neutrino mass is above the GeV scale, electroweak precision experiments provide strong constraints on non-unitarity.
The constraints are summarised below (from~\refref{Antusch:2008tz, Fernandez-Martinez:2016lgt, Blennow:2016jkn})
\begin{align*}
	&\varepsilon_{\alpha \beta} <
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\np{2.4e-2}	& \np{1.3e-2}	& \np{3.5e-2}	\\
		\cdot		& \np{2.2e-2}	& \np{6.0e-3}	\\
		\cdot		& \cdot		& \np{1.0e-1}
	\end{pmatrix}\quad 
	\text{if 10\,eV} \lesssim m_N \lesssim \text{1\,GeV}\ ,\\
	&\varepsilon_{\alpha \beta} <
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\np{1.3e-3}	& \np{1.2e-5}	& \np{1.4e-3}	\\
		\cdot		& \np{2.2e-4}	& \np{6.0e-4}	\\
		\cdot		& \cdot		& \np{2.8e-3}
	\end{pmatrix}\quad
	\text{if}\ m_N \gtrsim \text{1\,GeV}\ .
\end{align*}

The $\mu_R$ and $\mu_S$ entries of the ISS matrices naturally lead to lepton flavour and lepton number violating processes.
The most constrained process is the decay rate of \mbox{$\mu^+ \to e^+\gamma$}, the branching ratio of which is given in \refeq{eq:meg}.
The current upper limit on the branching ratio is \np{4.2e-13}, but a future upgrade of the experiment %
foresees to reach a limit lower than \np{5e-14}.

Heavy neutrinos in a ISS model also contribute to the neutrinoless double beta decay.
The effective neutrino mass $m_{\beta\beta}$ receives further corrections with respect %
to the standard expression as
\begin{equation}
	m_{\beta\beta} \simeq \abs{\sum_i \hat{U}_{e i}^2 \frac{p^2\,m_i}{p^2 - m_i^2}}
\end{equation}
where $p^2 \simeq -\np{0.015}$\,GeV\tapi{2} is the typical virtual momentum of the exchanged neutrino.
The~contribution from masses above the 100\,MeV scale drops as $\flatfrac{1}{m^2_i}$ while it is constant for masses below~\cite{Blennow:2010th}.
It is interesting to note that the contributions given by pseudo-Dirac pairs are subject to partial cancellation, regulated by the LNV parameters.
In the LNC limit, the cancellation is maximum and the paired states do not take part in the $0\nu\beta\beta$ process.
The latest result from the KamLAND-Zen experiment~\cite{KamLAND-Zen:2016pfg} is interpreted as~\mbox{$m_{\beta\beta} < 61$\,meV}.
%The latest result from the GERDA experiment~\cite{Agostini:2017iyd} is interpreted as $m_{\beta\beta} < 150$\,meV.

We find, for the first two ISS scenarios, that the allowed ranges span in the space %
\mbox{$m_D \sim 10^{[3,6]}$\,eV}, \mbox{$M_R \sim 10^{[6,15]}$\,eV}, $\mu_S$ and $\mu_R \sim 10^{[-4,1]}$\,eV.
We check that each matrix generated respects the \emph{naturalness condition} in the 't Hooft sense~\cite{tHooft:1980xss} %
and that the mass spectrum presents a mass state accessible by the DUNE experiment.
For the third ISS case, large entries of the sub-matrix $\mu_S$ are necessary to give the Majorana state a mass that %
can be probed by the experiment.
We find the ranges of \mbox{$m_D \sim 10^{[3,10]}$\,eV}, $M_R \sim 10^{[7,15]}$\,eV, $\mu_S \sim 10^{[4,9]}$\,eV to respect %
the constraints.
The hierarchy and naturalness conditions are relaxed in this case.
It is found that the block $\mu_R$ does not influence the final mass spectrum; %
it usually gives contribution to the light neutrino masses at the loop level, in a region below the GeV scale that has been already excluded by experiments.
%The neutrino masses and the mixing elements are extracted from the mass matrices that survive all the experimental constraints.
The resulting points in the space $(m_N, |U_{\alpha N}|^2)$ are clustered together and the regions defined are overlaid in \reffig{fig:sensAll}.
Any combination of mass and mixing element inside these areas can be justified by a valid neutrino mass matrix %
which can explain the light neutrino masses and survive the experimental constraints.
The pseudo-Dirac pairs from the ISS\,(2,2) and ISS\,(2,3) scenarios give very similar regions, %
but Majorana states from the ISS\,(2,3) realisation can only be generated with very small couplings.
A type I seesaw band, corresponding to light neutrino mass between 20~meV and 200~meV, %
is plotted as well for comparison.

\subsection{Overall sensitivity}

We define the overall sensitivity of DUNE ND to the discovery of HNL as the combination of the sensitivities to selected channels, %
presented in \refsec{sec:results}.
These channels are $N\to\nu e e$, $\nu e \mu$, $\nu \mu \mu$, $\nu \pi^0$, $e \pi$, $\mu \pi$ and are preferred because of %
their good discovery prospect, for which backgrounds have also been studied.
They all give strong sensitivities, especially for masses below 500\,MeV.
Their reach is due to high branching ratios and also to clean and well-defined signatures in the detector, %
allowing the background to be controlled with sufficient precision.
The neutrino spectrum component coming from the $D_s$ meson allows for weaker sensitivity %
to masses above the neutral kaon mass.
We conducted the sensitivity study for both scenarios, in which either a Majorana or a Dirac neutrino is the decaying particle.

\end{figure}

To appreciate the ND performance, we make a comparison with results of previous experiments, %
in particular PS191~\cite{Bernardi:1985ny, Bernardi:1987ek}, peak searches~\cite{Artamonov:2014urb, Britton:1992pg, Britton:1992xv}, %
CHARM~\cite{Vilain:1994vg}, NuTeV~\cite{Vaitaitis:1999wq}, DELPHI~\cite{Abreu:1996pa}, and T2K~\cite{Abe:2019kgx}.
We find that the DUNE ND can increase the bound on the electronic and muonic mixing elements %
for masses $m_N < m_{K^0}$ with respect to previous experiments.
The constraint on the tauonic mixing is at least comparable with previous results.
For masses above, for which neutrino production relies on charm meson decays, the existing bounds %
are improved for the electronic mixing and the tauonic mixing, while a conservative result %
can be achieved in the muonic case.
We also overlay the prospects for the SBN programme~\cite{Ballett:2016opr}, %
NA62~\cite{Drewes:2018irr}, and the proposed SHiP~\cite{Alekhin:2015byh} and FASER~\cite{Kling:2018wct} with 1\,m radius.
DUNE ND will give the best sensitivity for masses below the 500\,MeV in all channels, but the tauonic one.
However, anywhere the $D_s$ meson production is involved, the experiment cannot outperform the predicted %
sensitivity of the SHiP experiment which will deploy a 400\,GeV proton beam on a titanium-zinc-molybdenum alloy %
target, enhancing the production of charm and bottom mesons.
NA62 gives better results for the $|U_{\mu N}|^2$ mixing, but DUNE has a better sensitivity %
to the electron and tau channels.
FASER is comparable to NA62 in sensitivity, but it can reach regions of the parameter space beyond the 2\,GeV limit %
to which DUNE is not sensitive.

We then compare the overall sensitivity to regions allowed by neutrino mass models.
In the electronic and muonic channels, DUNE ND will be sensitive to a large part of the pseudo-Dirac regions, %
corresponding to ISS\,(2,2) and ISS\,(2,3) models, %
part of which have been already excluded by past experiments.
DUNE will close the gap and put to test type I seesaw parameters, especially for HNL masses between 200 and 500\,MeV, %
starting to reach the region of ISS\,(2,3) with large lepton number violation.
For the tauonic channel, the experiment will probe only a small portion %
of pseudo-Dirac pairs from ISS\,(2,2) and ISS\,(2,3) models.
The sensitivity is not high enough to reach type I and Majorana state regions, which not even the dedicated experiment SHiP can.

\end{figure}

The ISS\,(2,3) scenario in which the pseudo-Dirac pair is accessible by the experiment also predicts a light %
Majorana state, the mass of which is controlled by the small LNV perturbations.
This entails the presence of a third mass splitting $\Delta m^2_{4 1}$, which could give %
an active-sterile oscillation signature in short baseline experiments.
In figure Fig.~\ref{fig:sblosc}, the new mass splitting is plotted against the mixings $|U_{e 4}|^2$, %
$|U_{\mu 4}|^2$ and the combination usually referred to as %
$\sin^2 2\theta_{\mu e} \equiv 4 |U_{e 4}|^2|U_{\mu 4}|^2$.
The mass splittings generated in the matrix scan span from %
$\Delta m^2_{3 1} \simeq \np{0.0025}$\,eV\tapi{2} up to \np{e4}\,eV\tapi{2}, and the squared mixings cover a large region, %
down to \np{e-14} for all the flavours.
The reactor anomalies could be soon excluded at the 90\,\% C.L. by the DANSS experiment~\cite{Alekseev:2018efk} %
and the allowed regions from LSND~\cite{Aguilar:2001ty} and %
MiniBooNE~\cite{Aguilar-Arevalo:2012fmn, Aguilar-Arevalo:2013pmq, Aguilar-Arevalo:2018gpe} %
require values of $\sin^2 2\theta_{\mu e} \gtrsim \np{e-3}$.
Given the results of the matrix scan, it is unlikely that one of the ISS\,(2,3) realisations %
considered in this work could link an heavy neutrino--like signal in DUNE ND and explain a short baseline anomaly at the same time, %

unless for sparse and very fine-tuned points.

\section{List of integrals and identities}
\label{app:integrals}

In presenting the differential and total decay rates in~\refsec{sec:decay} and~\ref{sec:production}, %
we have used a series of simplifying integrals and functions of the particle masses.
We report them jointly here.
The letters $x$, $y$, and $z$ denote squared ratios of masses, while $s$, $t$, and $u$ are the corresponding Mandelstam variables for three body decays.

\subsection{Decay widths}

In~\cite{Atre:2009rg}, the following functions are used to express the total rates of two-body decays  
%
\begin{align*}
	%
	I_1 (x, y) &= \kallen(1, x, y)\, \qty[(1-x)^2 - y(1+x)]\ ,\\
	%
	I_2 (x, y) &= \kallen(1, x, y)\, \qty[(1+x-y)(1+x+2y)-4x]\ ,
	%
\end{align*}
%
and the rate of three-body decays can be expressed in terms of two more functions \cite{Atre:2009rg}, 
%
\begin{align*}
	I_1(x,y,z) &= 12 \int\limits_{\qty(\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{y})^2}^{\qty(1-\sqrt{z})^2}\!\! %
	\frac{\dd{s}}{s} (s-x-y)\,(1+z-s)\kallen(1,x,y)\kallen(1,s,z)\ ,\\
	%
	I_2(x,y,z)&=24\,\sqrt{yz} \int\limits_{\qty(\sqrt{y}+\sqrt{z})^2}^{\qty(1-\sqrt{x})^2}\!\! %
	\frac{\dd{s}}{s}(1+x-s)\kallen(s,y,z)\kallen(1,s,x)\ .
\end{align*}
%
In this work we have introduced two differential generalisations of the two-body formulae,
%
\begin{align*}
	I^\pm_1 (x, y; \theta) &= \frac{1}{4\pi}\kallen(1, x, y) \qty[(1-x)^2 - y\,(1+x) \pm (x-1)\kallen(1, x, y) \cos\theta]\ ,\\
	%
	I^\pm_2 (x, y;\theta) &= \frac{1}{4\pi}\kallen(1, x, y) \qty[(1+x-y)\,(1+x+2y)-4x \pm (x+2y-1)\kallen(1, x, y) \cos\theta]\ .
\end{align*}
%
Our expressions satisfy the normalisation conditions,  
%
\begin{align*}     
	\int_0^{2\pi} \!\! \dd{\varphi}\!\int_{-1}^1\!\!\dd{\cos\theta}\, I^\pm_1(x,y;\theta)&= I_1(x,y)\ ,\\
	%
	\int_0^{2\pi} \!\! \dd{\varphi}\!\int_{-1}^1\!\!\dd{\cos\theta}\, I^\pm_2(x,y;\theta) &= I_2(x,y)\ . 
\end{align*}
%
We also note the following integrals which are necessary in deriving the total decay rate for the three-body leptonic modes, 
% 
\begin{align}   
	\int\!\! \dd{s_1}\!\! \int\!\! \dd{s_2}\, (s_2-\xi^2_3)(1+\xi^2_4-s_2) &= \frac{I_1(0,\xi^2_3,\xi_4^2)}{12}\ ,\label{eq:threebody_int1}\\ 
	%
	\int\!\! \dd{s_1}\!\! \int\!\! \dd{s_2}\, (s_1-\xi^2_4)(1+\xi^2_3-s_1) &= \frac{I_1(0,\xi^2_4,\xi_3^2)}{12}\ ,\label{eq:threebody_int2}\\ 
	%\
	\int\!\! \dd{s_1}\!\! \int\!\! \dd{s_2}\ 2\xi_3\,\xi_4(s_1+s_2-\xi^2_3-\xi^2_3) &= %
	\frac{I_2(0,\xi^2_3,\xi_4^2)}{12}\ ,\label{eq:threebody_int3}
\end{align}
where $\xi_i$ have the same meanings of \refeqs{eq:threebody_1}{eq:threebody_2}.
%\begin{align}   
%%
%\int\!\! ds_1\!\!\int\!\! ds_2\, (s_2-\xi^2_3)(1+\xi^2_4-s_2) &= \int_{\xi^2_3}^{(1-\xi_4)^2}\!\! \frac{ds_2}{s_2}\, (s_2-\xi^2_3)^2(1+\xi^2_4-s_2)\lambda^\frac{1}{2}(1,s_2,\xi^2_4), \nonumber\\
%%
%&= \frac{I_1(0,\xi^2_3,\xi_4^2)}{12},\label{eq:threebody_int1}\\ 
%%
%\int\!\! ds_1\!\!\int\!\! ds_2\, (s_1-\xi^2_4)(1+\xi^2_3-s_1) &= \int_{\xi^2_4}^{(1-\xi_3)^2}\!\! \frac{ds_1}{s_1}\, (s_1-\xi^2_4)^2(1+\xi^2_3-s_1)\lambda^\frac{1}{2}(1,s_1,\xi^2_3),\nonumber\\ 
%%
%&= \frac{I_1(0,\xi^2_4,\xi_3^2)}{12},\label{eq:threebody_int2}\\ 
%%
%\int\!\! ds_1\!\!\int\!\! ds_2\, 2\xi_3\xi_4(s_1+s_2-\xi^2_3-\xi^2_3) &=2\xi_3\xi_4\int_{(\xi_3+\xi_4)^2}^{1}\!\! \frac{ds_3}{s_3}\, (1-s_3)^2\lambda^\frac{1}{2}(s_3,\xi^2_3,\xi^2_4),\nonumber\\
%%
%&= \frac{I_2(0,\xi^2_3,\xi_4^2)}{12}.\label{eq:threebody_int3}
%%
%\end{align*}

\subsection{Scaling factors for three body-decays}

%The following integrals are used in \refsec{sec:production} to 
%\subsubsection{Production from leptons}

%The decay rates for leptons needs the following two
Three-body lepton decays can produce neutrinos in two ways, depending on whether the neutrino mixes with %
the initial or with the final flavour.
The expressions presented in~\refsec{sec:production} make use of the following integrals:
\begin{align*}
	I^\pm_\ell(x, y, z) = 12 \int\limits_{\qty(\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{y})^2}^{\qty(1-\sqrt{z})^2}\!\!  \frac{\dd{s}}{s} % 
	%I^\pm_\ell(x, y, z) = 12 \int\limits_{(x+y)^2}^{(1-z)^2}\!\!
	&\qty(1 + z - s) \qty[s - x - y \mp \kallen(s, x, y) ] \\
	&\times \kallen(s, x, y) \kallen(1, s, z)\ ,
\end{align*}
% 
\begin{align*}
	I^\pm_{\cj{\ell}}(x, y, z) = 12 \int\limits_{\qty(\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{y})^2}^{\qty(1-\sqrt{z})^2}\!\!  \frac{\dd{s}}{s} % 
	%I^\pm_{\cj{\ell}}(x, y, z) = 12 \int\limits_{(x+y)^2}^{(1-z)^2}\!\! \frac{\dd{s}}{s} %
	&\qty[1 + z - s \mp \kallen(1, s, z) ] \qty(s - x - y) \\
	&\times \kallen(s, y, z) \kallen(1, s, z)\ .
\end{align*}
%
When averaging over the helicity states, these two functions become identical and, because of symmetry crossing, %
also identical to the integral $I_1(x, y, z)$, expressed above.

%\subsubsection{Production from mesons}

In~\refsec{sec:production}, the three-body decay rate of pseudoscalar meson requires the following integral:
\begin{align*}
	I^\pm_h(x, y, z) = \int\limits_{\qty(\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{y})^2}^{\qty(1-\sqrt{z})^2}\!\!
	%I^\pm_h(x, y, z) = \int\limits_{(x+y)^2}^{(1-z)^2}\!\!
	\dd{s} \int_{t_-}^{t_+}\!\! %
	\dd{t} \qty[ F^2 A^\pm(s, t) + G^2 B^\pm(s, t) - \Re(F^* G)\,C^\pm(s, t) ]\ , \\
	\text{with}\quad t_\pm = x + z + \frac{ (1-s-z)(s - y + x) \pm \kallen(s, y, z)\kallen(1, s, z) }{2 s}\ ,
\end{align*}
where $F$ and $G$ are convenient combinations of hadronic form factors $f^{(h,h')}$.
From lattice QCD considerations, form factors should carry the correct Clebsch-Gordan, %
but here we drop them as they are irrelevant when studying scale factors.
The combinations $F$ and $G$ are
\begin{align*}
	F &= 2\ f_+^{(h,h')}(u) = f_+^{(h,h')}(0)%
	\qty(1 + \lambda^{(h,h')}_+ \frac{u}{x})\ , \\
	G &= f_+^{(h,h')}(u) - f_-^{(h,h')}(u) = f_+^{(h,h')}(0)%
	\qty[1 + \lambda^{(h,h')}_+ \frac{u}{x} - %
	\qty(\lambda^{(h,h')}_+ - \lambda^{(h,h')}_0) \qty( 1 + \frac{1}{x})]\ ,
\end{align*}
with $\lambda$ parametrising the linear dependence~\cite{PDG} of the form factors %
with respect the momentum transfer between the two mesons, $u$, %
directly connected to the other Mandelstam variables, $s$ and $t$:
\begin{equation*}
	u = 1 + x + y + z - s - t\ .
\end{equation*}
The values of $\lambda_{+,0}$ is determined experimentally~\cite{PDG}.
The functions $A$, $B$, and $C$ are
\begin{align*}
	A^\pm(s, t) &= \frac{1}{2}(1 + y - t) \qty[ 1 + z - s \mp \kallen(1, z, s) ] - %
	\frac{1}{2}\qty[u - y - z \mp \kallen(u, y, z)]\ , \\
	B^\pm(s, t) &= \frac{1}{2}(y + z) (u - y - z) + 2 y z \mp (y - z) \frac{\kallen(u, y, z)}{2}\ , \\
	C^\pm(s, t) &= z (1 + y - t) + \qty[y \pm \frac{\kallen(u, y, z)}{2}] (1 + z - s)\ . 
\end{align*}
When summing over helicity states, the kinematic simplifies to
\begin{align*}
	A(s, t) &= (1 + y - t)( 1 + z - s) - (u - y - z)\ , \\
	B(s, t) &= (y + z) (u - y - z) + 4\, y\, z\ , \\
	C(s, t) &= 2\, z\, (1 + y - t) + 2\, y\, (1 + z - s)\ .
\end{align*}

\section{Polarised $N\to\nu \ell_\alpha^-\ell^+_\beta$ distributions}
\label{app:threebody_dist}

%The differential decay rate for the process $N(k_1) \to \nu(k_2) e_\alpha^-(k_3)e^+_\beta(k_4)$ depends on five phase space variables. We choose to write the results in the form 
%%
%\[  d\Gamma_\pm = \frac{G_F^2 m_N^5}{16 \pi^3} |A_\pm|^2 ds_1ds_2\frac{d^2\Omega_3}{4\pi}\frac{d\varphi_{43}}{2\pi}, \]
%%
%with $|A_\pm|$ denoting the ampltude for the decay of a heavy neutrino with helicity $h=\pm1$. 
%%
%The integration is done over the reduced Mandelstam variables $(k_2+k_3)^2=m_N^2s_1$ and $(k_2+k_4)^2=m_N^2s_2$ as well as three angular variables defined by the lab-frame direction of $e^-_\alpha$, $\Omega_3 = (\theta_3, \phi_3)$, and the relative azimuthal between $e^-_\alpha$ and $e^+_\beta$, $\varphi_{43}$. Which take values over the full (solid-)angular range.
%%
%%The ranges of the Mandelstam variables are
%%%
%%\[  \xi_4^2 \le s_1 \le (1-\xi_3)^2 \qquad \text{and} \qquad \xi_4^2 \le s_2 \le (1-\xi_3)^2, \]
%%%
%%or equivalently, 
%%
%
%
%Depending on the nature of the neutrino and the flavours the distribution will change. However, all decays can be expressed in terms of a common functional form. We define two functions, representing the isotropic and angular parts of the amplitude,

\subsection{Dirac $\nu_i$} 
%
The coefficients for a Dirac neutrino decay are given by 
%
\begin{align*}
	C^\nu_1 &= C^\nu_4= \sum_{\gamma =e}^\tau |U_{\gamma i}|^2 \qty[\delta_{\alpha\beta} g_L^2+ %
	\delta_{\gamma\alpha}(1+\delta_{\alpha\beta}g_L)]\ ,\\ 
	%
	C^\nu_2 &= C^\nu_5= \delta_{\alpha\beta}\,g^2_R\sum_{\gamma = e}^\tau |U_{\gamma i}|^2\ ,\\ 
	%
	C^\nu_3 &= C^\nu_6= \delta_{\alpha\beta}\,g_R\sum_{\gamma = e}^\tau |U_{\gamma i}|^2(\delta_{\gamma\beta} + g_L)\ ,
\end{align*}
%
where the chiral couplings for charged leptons are given by $g_L = -\frac{1}{2} + \sin^2\theta_\text{W}$ 
and \mbox{$g_R = \sin^2\theta_\text{W}$}.

\subsection{Dirac $\overline{\nu}_i$}  
%
The coefficients for the Dirac antineutrino decay---which involve some vital minus signs compared %
to the neutrino case---are given by 
%
\begin{align*}
	C^{\cj{\nu}}_1 &= -C^{\overline{\nu}}_4 = \delta_{\alpha\beta}\,g^2_R\sum_{\gamma = e}^\tau |U_{\gamma i}|^2\ ,\\
	%
	C^{\cj{\nu}}_2 &= -C^{\overline{\nu}}_5 = \sum_{\gamma =e}^\tau |U_{\gamma i}|^2 %
	\qty[ \delta_{\alpha\beta} g_L^2+ \delta_{\gamma\beta}(1+\delta_{\alpha\beta}g_L)]\ ,\\
	%
	C^{\cj{\nu}}_3 &= -C^{\overline{\nu}}_6 = \delta_{\alpha \beta}\, g_R\sum_{\gamma = e}^\tau |U_{\gamma i}|^2(\delta_{\alpha\gamma} + g_L)\ ,
\end{align*}
%
where the chiral couplings $g_L$ and $g_R$ have the same meaning.

\subsection{Majorana $N_i$}  
%
The amplitude for Majorana decay is the sum of the Dirac neutrino and Dirac antineutrino amplitudes given above:%
\footnote{In general, there are interference terms between ``neutrino'' and ``antineutrino'' diagrams; %
	however all such contributions are suppressed by the mass scale of the outgoing light neutrino, %
	which is taken to be zero in these calculations.}
%
\begin{equation*}
	|A_\pm|^2 = |A^\nu_\pm|^2 + |A^{\cj{\nu}}_\pm|^2\ .
\end{equation*} 
%
%& = |A_0^\nu|^2 + |A^{\overline{\nu}}_0|^2 \pm \left( |A_1^\nu|^2 - |A^{\overline{\nu}}_1|^2  \right).\end{align*}
%
Crucially, this means that the coefficients in the isotropic terms are the sum of those for a neutrino and antineutrino while the coefficients in the angular terms are the difference, leading to cancellations.
%
All in all, we find
%
\begin{equation*}
	|A_\pm|^2 = |A_0|^2 \pm |A_1|^2\ , 
\end{equation*}
%
with the coefficients
%
\begin{align*}
	C_1&=C_1^\nu + C_1^{\cj{\nu}} = \sum_{\gamma =e}^\tau |U_{\gamma i}|^2 \qty[ (g_L^2+g_R^2)\delta_{\alpha\beta} + %
	\delta_{\gamma\alpha}(1+\delta_{\alpha\beta}g_L)]\ ,\\
	%
	C_2&=C_2^\nu + C_2^{\cj{\nu}} = \sum_{\gamma =e}^\tau |U_{\gamma i}|^2 \qty[ (g_L^2+g_R^2)\delta_{\alpha\beta} + %
	\delta_{\gamma\beta}(1+\delta_{\alpha\beta}g_L)]\ ,\\
	%
	C_3&=C_3^\nu + C_3^{\cj{\nu}} = 2\delta_{\alpha\beta}\,g_R\sum_{\gamma = e}^\tau |U_{\gamma i}|^2(\delta_{\alpha\gamma} + g_L)\ ,\\
	%
	C_4&=C_1^\nu -C_1^{\cj{\nu}} = \sum_{\gamma =e}^\tau |U_{\gamma i}|^2 \qty[ \delta_{\alpha\beta}(g_L^2-g_R^2) + %
	\delta_{\gamma\alpha}(1+\delta_{\alpha\beta}g_L)]\ ,\\
	%
	C_5&=C_2^\nu - C_2^{\cj{\nu}} = -\sum_{\gamma =e}^\tau |U_{\gamma i}|^2 \qty[ \delta_{\alpha\beta}(g_L^2-g_R^2) + %
	\delta_{\gamma\beta}(1+\delta_{\alpha\beta}g_L)]\ ,\\
	%
	C_6&= C_3^\nu - C_3^{\cj{\nu}} = 0\ .
\end{align*}
%
Note that for the three-body decays, the decay is not isotropic in the Majorana limit; however, the quantity $g_L^2 - g_R^2 \approx 0.02$, suppresses the angular terms in the pure NC case.

	\caption{These are the four diagrams contributing to the hard process in open charm production.
		The diagrams with gluons in the initial state interfere with each other giving rise to %
		cross terms in the colour structure.}
	\label{fig:parton}
\end{figure}

Following the same procedure as the one described in~\refref{Alekhin:2015byh}, %
we estimate the number of strange $D$ mesons to be
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{N}_{D_s} = \frac{\sigma_{c \cj{c}}}{\sigma_{p A}} f_{D_s} = (2.8 \pm 0.2) \times \np{e-6}\ ,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_{c \cj{c}} = \np{12}\pm\np{1}$\,\textmu b is the proton-target open charm cross section, %
$\sigma_{p A} = \np{331.4}\pm\np{3.4}$\,mb is the total inelastic proton-target on carbon ($A =$ \tapi{12}C)~\cite{RamanaMurthy:1975vfu} %
cross section, and $f_{D_s} = \np{7.7}\,\%$ is the $D_s$ fragmentation fraction~\cite{Abramowicz:2013eja}.
%where $\sigma_{c \cj{c}}$ is the proton-target open charm cross section, $\sigma_{p A}$ is the total inelastic %
%proton-target inelastic cross section, and $f_{D_s}$ is the $D_s$ fragmentation fraction.[h]
We calculate the open charm production cross section at the leading order in perturbation theory, with a %
graphite fixed target and a 80\,GeV proton $p$.
The correct process to consider is the proton--nucleon interaction, therefore %
\begin{equation*}
	\sigma_{c \cj{c}} \equiv \sigma(pA \to c \cj{c} + X) \approx A\,\sigma(pN \to c \cj{c} +X)\ , %
\end{equation*}
using the correct Parton Distribution Function (PDF) for a bound nucleon $N$ in the nucleus $A$.
There are four diagrams, shown in figure~\reffig{fig:parton}, that contributes to the cross section, %
but three of them interfere with each other.
These cross sections are well-known SM calculations and can be found in~\refref{PDG}.
The integrated cross section is:
\begin{multline}
	\sigma(pN \to c \cj{c} + X) = \int_{\tau_0}^1 \dd{x_1} \int_{\frac{\tau_0}{x_1}}^1 \dd{x_2} \int \dd{\Omega} %
	\bigg[\qty(f_{g/p}^1\, f_{g/A}^2 + f_{g/p}^2\, f_{g/A}^1) \dv{\sigma_{gg \to c \cj{c}}}{\Omega} \\
	+\sum_{q=u,d,s} \qty(f_{q/p}^1\, f_{\cj{q}/A}^2 + f_{q/p}^2\, f_{\cj{q}/A}^1 + %
	f_{\cj{q}/p}^1\, f_{q/A}^2 + f_{\cj{q}/p}^2\, f_{q/A}^1) \dv{\sigma_{q\cj{q} \to c \cj{c}}}{\Omega}\bigg]\ ,
\end{multline}
with $\tau_0 = \hat{s}_0 / s$ and $\hat{s}_0$ being the threshold energy at the partonic level and %
$s = 2 m_p ( m_p + E_p)$ is the centre of mass energy, given that $m_p \simeq m_n$.
The partonic structure of the nucleus is described by the functions $f_{\rho/\eta}^i = f_{\rho/\eta}(x_i, M_F)$, %
which are interpreted as the probability of finding a parton $\rho$ in the particle $\eta$ %
carrying a $x_i$ fraction of the momentum of $\eta$, at the energy scale $M_F$.	
The two momentum fractions are related by $x_1\,x_2\,s = \hat{s}$, where the hat symbol denotes the energy %
of the parton-level process.



We adopt a factorisation scale of $M_F = 2.1\, m_c$ for the computation of $\sigma_{c \cj{c}}$, 
while the renormalisation scale of $\alpha_s$ is set to $\mu_R = 1.6\, m_c$, and the charm mass has the value %
\mbox{$m_c = (\np{1.28}\pm\np{0.03})$\,GeV}.
The integration is regulated for $|\cos \theta| < 0.8$, with $\theta$ the angle in the centre of mass frame.
The theoretical curve in Fig.~7.4(a) of~\refref{Alekhin:2015byh} was used to check our evaluation, %
and it was successfully reproduced up to NLO corrections.
For~the calculation we employed LHAPDF~\cite{Buckley:2014ana} and the nCTEQ15 PDF set~\cite{Kovarik:2015cma}, %
resulting in $\sigma_{pA \to c \cj{c}} = (\np{12}\pm1)\,\mu$b, for an 80\,GeV protons on a graphite target.

\section{Background reduction}
\label{sec:appbackground}

We performed a background analysis only for the decay channels with an important discovery potential, %
and these are $N \to \nu e^+ e^-$, $\nu e^\pm \mu^\mp$, $\nu \mu^+\mu^-$, $\nu\pi^0$, $e^\mp\pi^\pm$, and $\mu^\mp\pi^\pm$. 
The advantage of these channels is that they give the best sensitivities to new physics, thanks to both their %
high branching ratios and the flux intensity in the region of interest.
Moreover, the final state particle are all well-studied particles, most of which leave clean tracks in the detector.
As an example of the background reduction using kinematic cuts, we present here the background analysis for %
a sterile neutrino with mass $m_N = 300$\,MeV.

With respect to the following tables, the values presented are in the form ``$\mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$'', %
where $\mathcal{X}$ is the per mille (\np{e-3}) fraction of background events %
from mis-identification and $\mathcal{Y}$ is the per mille fraction of irreducible background %
after the application of data cuts based on kinematic properties.
When the value $\np{0e-3}$ is shown, we mean that less than one background event per million is expected.
The average was computed by weighting the flux components contribution to the background, using the %
respective interaction rate as weights, reported in Tab.~\ref{tab:rate}.
We assume that the $\nu_\tau$ and $\cj{\nu}_\tau$ components are not responsible for background events, therefore only the $\nu_e$, $\nu_\mu$, %
and $\cj{\nu}_\mu$ components are studied.
The last two rows of the tables are the percentage of signal events retained, after the kinematic cuts are applied %
to the MC simulation of Majorana and Dirac neutrinos.
Because of the overwhelming background, the number of signal events are most of the time substantially influenced.

We group the studied channels in three categories, which have similar kinematic features: %
two-body decay, which are semi-leptonic, three-body decay channels, which are purely leptonic instead, and %
decays which can be only detected via photon reconstruction.
%We limit our analysis only for events with a total energy greater than 5~GeV, unless stated differently.

\subsection{Two-body decays}

The two-body decays $N \to e^\pm \pi^\mp$ and $N \to \mu^\pm \pi^\mp$ are the most promising channels for the detection %
of a heavy neutrino, being the decay mode with the highest branching ratios.
The typical signal is a two charged particle tracks with a common vertex, in a $V^0$-like fashion.
Muons and pions leave a clean signature in the fine grained tracker and the LArTPC, %
and electrons are easily reconstructed.
They give direct information on the parent particle, being the invariant mass of the process the %
same as the mass of the decaying neutrino, $m_N^2 = s = m_\ell^2 + m_\pi^2 + 2E_\ell E_\pi - 2|\vb{p}_\ell| |\vb{p}_\pi| \cos \theta$, %
where $\theta$ is the opening angle between the lepton and the pion.
Moreover, the two particles are emitted back-to-back in the neutrino reference frame, and, once the system %
is boosted in the direction of the decaying neutrino, the relative position on the perpendicular plane %
is preserved.
The CC interactions of $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu$ are the main background processes, %
because additional photons or pions can be mis-identified for electrons or muons.
We therefore cut on the separation angle between the charged particles, which are very boosted forward, %
and we request that they are in opposite direction on the plane perpendicular to the beamline.
An energy threshold on the reconstructed neutrino, above 5\,GeV, is also imposed, %
as the background events peak at lower energies.
The background events are reduced up to a factor $\mathcal{O}(\np{e4})$, %
whereas $\sim$46\,\% of the Majorana neutrino events and $\sim$40\,\% of the Dirac neutrino events lie above the cuts.

\subsection{Three-body decays}

The three-body decays studied are $N\to \nu e^- e^+$, $N\to \nu e^\mp \mu^\pm$, and $N\to \nu \mu^- \mu^+$.
The~principle sources of background are mis-reconstructed photons, which promptly converts to electron-positron pairs, %
or pion tracks that are too long and identified as muons.
Despite this, the mis-ID rate is already low as two leptons are needed to identify these channels.
However, the background analysis in the case of three-body decays is further complicated by the loss of the light neutrino %
and so direct information on the parent particle may not be recovered; %
there is some missing transverse momentum, even though small because of the neutrino lightness.
Cuts on the distribution of the transverse momenta of electrons and muons can therefore help reject background events, %
which deviate from the beam line direction.
We find, nonetheless, that cuts on the invariant mass of the charged lepton system %
\enlargethispage{\baselineskip}
are useful to discriminate signal from background.
The energy range considered for the lepton-pairs is different for the channels $\nu e^- e^+$ ($E_{ee} > 2$\,GeV), %
$\nu e^\mp \mu^\pm$ ($E_{e\mu} > 4$\,GeV), and $\nu \mu^-\mu^+$ ($E_{\mu\mu} > 5$\,GeV), %
due to  different distributions of the background energy spectra in the three cases.
The cuts applied to the two-electron channel are the ones with the highest signal selection efficiency, %
yet reducing the background by a factor $\sim200$.
On the contrary, the two-muon channel has the highest mis-identification rate, %
and so the worst selection success for three-body decays.
The electron--muon channel lies in between the other two, presenting though the lowest mis-ID rate. 
The slightly different behaviours between the kinematics of Majorana and Dirac neutrinos is emphasised %
by the selection efficiencies of the $\nu e^- e^+$ channel.
This tendency is lost as the signal efficiency decreases in the other two channels.

\subsection{EM--detected decays}

The semi-leptonic decay $N \to \nu \pi^0$ may only be identified by a correct photon reconstruction, %
since the neutral pion decays almost 100\,\% of the time in two photons.
This particle is extensively produced in CC and NC neutrino-nucleon interactions, %
while individual photon background is due to badly reconstructed EM showers, %
occurring especially in $\nu_e$--CC interactions.
If a pair of $\gamma$ is detected and their invariant mass is compatible with $m_{\pi^0}$, %
the parent pion is reconstructed.
Afterwards, we compare the transverse momenta of the single photons with the transverse momentum %
of their parent particle, and we set constraints on the separation angle between the two $\gamma$.
We consider only photons with an energy greater than 1\,GeV, to avoid the dominant low-energy background.
The selection cuts results to be more severe for this mode, leaving signal events just below 20\,\%, %
but obtaining a reasonable background reduction of a factor of 500.
This detection channel is the most challenging, among those studied, because of the multiple background sources.
However, it is one of the decay modes with the highest branching ratio, and with advanced and dedicated techniques~\cite{Ankowski:2008aa, Back:2012wc}
the reconstruction efficiency can be improved, as well as the background rejection.
