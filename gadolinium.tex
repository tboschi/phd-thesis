\chapter{Continuous gadolinium measurement}


Addition of water-soluble gadolinium salt Gd\tped{2}(SO\tped{4})\tped{3} %
enables a water Cherenkov detector to efficient identification of low energy anti-neutrinos, %
one of the main component of the Supernova Relic Neutrino (SNR) signal.

Capture of a thermal neutron on \textbf{hydrogen} has a cross section of %
$\np{332.6}\pm\np{0.7}$~mb, %
characteristic time of $\sim200$~\textmu s in water, emitting $\np{2.2}$~MeV gammas.
Capture on gadolinium has a cross section of $\np{49e3}$~b, emitting~$\sim\np{8}$~MeV gammas.
Characteristic time of $\sim30$~\textmu s for \np{0.2}\,\% Gd-water solution. 

The concentration of Gd in water affects the \textbf{efficiency} and \textbf{timing} of neutron captures, %
antineutrino measurements depends on this.

It is fundamental to measure the concentration \textbf{regularly}: %
it can change in time inside the tank (\textbf{temperature} and \textbf{flow} dependency).

Measure absorption lines of Gd, around 275~nm.
Use a UV source and a spectrometer.
Extract the absorbance $A$.
Absorption is directly proportional to Gd\%.
