\chapter{Hyper-Kamiokande sensitivity to $\delta_\text{CP}$}
The violation of the CP symmetry is a well-known process in the quark sector of the standard model (SM),
giving clear evidence that the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix is complex.
As~three generations exist, an entirely analogous phenomenon is expected to arise in the lepton sector.
The leptonic mass mixing matrix, the Pontecorvo--Maki--Nakagawa--Sakata (PMNS) matrix, is usually parameterised as %
%\vspace{-0.2em}
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:pmns}
	U = \mqty( 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & c_{23} & s_{23} \\ 0 & -s_{23} & c_{23} ) %
	\mqty( c_{13} & 0 & s_{13}e^{-i\delta_\text{CP}} \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ -s_{13}e^{i\delta_\text{CP}} & 0 & c_{13} ) %
	\mqty( c_{12} & s_{12} & 0 \\ -s_{12} & c_{12} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 ) %
	\mqty( 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & e^{i\gamma_1} & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & e^{i\gamma_2} ) %
%\vspace{-0.2em}
\end{equation}
where $c_{ij} \equiv \cos\theta_{ij}$ and $s_{ij} \equiv \sin\theta_{ij}$.
The angle $\delta_\text{CP}$ is the phase responsible for CP violation, %
whereas the additional phases $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$ bring about CP violation if the neutrinos are Majorana.

C and CP violation are some of the conditions required in order to generate %
an asymmetry between matter and antimatter particles, together with %
baryon number violation and interactions out of thermal equilibrium~\cite{Sakharov:1967dj}.
%The observed baryon asymmetry in our Universe amounts to~\cite{Tanabashi:2018oca, Aghanim:2018eyx}
%\begin{equation*}
%	\eta = \frac{n_{B}}{n_\gamma}\quad,\quad \np{5.8e-10} \leq \eta \leq \np{6.6e-10}\quad\text{at}\ 95\% \text{C.L.}
%\end{equation*}
The amount of CP violation in the quark sector is not enough %
to describe the observed baryon asymmetry within the SM.
An asymmetry in the lepton sector, however, could be translated into baryogenesis, %
via non-perturbative sphaleronic processes~\cite{Fukugita:1986hr}.
This process, called \emph{leptogenesis}, would be allowed by the addition of %
right-handed Majorana neutrinos to the SM, which can violate lepton number.
This elegant solution to explain the baryon asymmetry is a strong motivation %
for searches of signals of CP violation in the lepton~sector.

\section{CP violation in neutrino oscillations}

The~best probe to discovery CP violation is neutrino oscillation, being a purely weak process in which %
\mbox{CP--con}\-ju\-gate processes can be easily studied.
The PMNS matrix relates flavour states $\alpha = e, \mu, \tau$ with mass eigenstates $i = 1, 2, 3$  %
as $\ket{\nu_\alpha} = \sum_i U^*_{\alpha i} \ket{\nu_i}$.
The probability of flavour oscillation in vacuum is hence computed as
%$P(\nu_\alpha \to \nu_\beta)$ is computed as $\qty|\mel{\nu_\alpha}{e^{-i\mathcal{H}t}}{\nu_\beta}|^2$ %
\vspace{-0.4em}
\begin{equation}
	P(\nu_\alpha \to \nu_\beta) \equiv \qty|\mel{\nu_\alpha}{e^{-i\mathcal{H}t}}{\nu_\beta}| ^2 = %
	\sum_{ij} U_{i\alpha}^* U_{\beta i} U_{\alpha j} U_{j\beta}^* %
	\exp \qty(-i \frac{\Delta m_{ij}^2 L}{2 E})\ ,
\vspace{-0.4em}
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{H}$ is the Hamiltonian, $t \simeq L$ and $\Delta m^2_{ij} = m_i^2 - m_j^2$, %
and it depends on the physical angles and phases of the PMNS matrix, %
with the exception of the Majorana phases $\gamma_{1,2}$.
The~\mbox{CP--con}\-jugate of a neutrino with negative helicity is an antineutrino with positive helicity, %
which, in terms of neutrino oscillations, means transforming the $\nu_\alpha \to \nu_\beta$ oscillation channel %
into the $\cj{\nu}_\alpha \to \cj{\nu}_\beta$ channel.
The violation of CP in neutrino oscillation can be quantified by the asymmetry in oscillation probabilities %
between neutrinos and antineutrinos
\vspace{-0.5em}
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:asymmetry}
	A^\text{CP}_{\alpha\beta} = P(\nu_\alpha \to \nu_\beta) - P(\cj{\nu}_\alpha \to \cj{\nu}_\beta) = %
	4 \sum_{i>j}\imaginary\qty[U_{i\alpha}^* U_{\beta i} U_{\alpha j} U_{j \beta}^*] \sin\qty(\frac{\Delta m_{ij}^2 L}{2E})\ .
\vspace{-0.3em}
\end{equation}
%with $t \simeq L$ and $\Delta m^2_{ij} = m_i^2 - m_j^2$.
It follows that CP violation can only be measured in ``appearance'' channels, as %
the argument of the imaginary part of Eq.~\ref{eq:asymmetry} is real for $\alpha = \beta$. % and so $A^\text{CP}_{\alpha\alpha} = 0$.
Furthermore, given the parametrisation in Eq.~\ref{eq:pmns}, %
this asymmetry is not measurable if the phase is trivial, \ie~$\delta_\text{CP} = 0$~or~$\pm \pi$, %
or if $\theta_{13}$ is vanishing.
From a model building point of view, however, a successful leptogenesis requires the parameters to satisfy %
$\qty|\sin\theta_{13} \sin\delta_\text{CP}| \gtrsim 0.09$
%\begin{equation}
%	\label{eq:leptogenesis}
%	\qty|\sin\theta_{13} \sin\delta_\text{CP}| \gtrsim 0.09\ ,
%\end{equation}
when the Majorana phases are vanishing~\cite{Pascoli:2006ci}.
The value of $\theta_{13}$ has been measured to be non-zero~\cite{Abe:2011sj,Abe:2011fz,An:2012eh,Ahn:2012nd} %
and for this reason it is expected that on-going and future generation neutrino experiments %
will also constrain the value of $\delta_\text{CP}$.
The effect of the CP--violating phase on the asymmetry of Eq.~\ref{eq:asymmetry} can be appreciated from the plot in Fig.~\ref{fig:mass}.

\section{Hyper-Kamiokande experiment}

Hyper-Kamiokande (HK)~\cite{Abe:2018uyc} will be the next-generation water Cherenkov detector, starting taking data from 2027.
Similar in concept to its predecessor, Super-Kamiokande (SK), the cylindrical tank of HK will be %
72\,m high and 68\,m in diameter, with a fiducial volume of 188.4\,kton, around 8.4 times the fiducial volume of SK.
The photo-coverage of the inner detector region will be 40\,\%, the same of SK, but it translates to roughly forty thousands %
photo\-multi\-pliers~(PMTs).
New PMTs, with twice the quantum efficiency of the previous generation  and improved charge %
and timing resolution, will be employed.
Thanks to incredible statistics and cutting edge resolutions, HK will be capable of a vast variety of physics studies, %
from accelerator and atmospheric neutrinos to solar and supernova neutrinos.
Besides detecting proton decay, the main goal of HK is to measure~$\delta_\text{CP}$ and constrain the other oscillation parameters %
with high precision.
This is achievable by studying accelerator neutrinos, and to this end the possibility of installing a second detector in Korea, %
at the secondary oscillation peak, is being investigated.

HK will be located 295\,km away from the target and $2.5^\circ$ off-axis with respect to the beamline.
The neutrino beam is generated by a 30\,GeV proton beam colliding on a fixed graphite target; %
a`focusing horn selects positively charged ($\nu$ mode) or negatively charged ($\cj{\nu}$ mode) pions, %
which decay leptonically, to obtain an almost pure muon neutrino or antineutrino beam, peaking at 600\,MeV.
The accelerator facility at J-PARC will undergo a planned upgrade to increase the beam power up to 1.3\,MW, %
before HK starts operation.
The T2K near detector system, comprised of the two modules ND280 and INGRID, will be refurbished %
and the new Intermediate Water Cherenkov Detector, possibly gadolinium-loaded, will be located %
around 1\,km from the target.

HK will take data for ten years, collecting a total of \np{2.7e22} Protons On Target, %
divided between $\nu$ and $\cj{\nu}$ beam modes.
%Studies have shown that CP violation discovery is not very sensitive to the time ratio between the two modes (ref?).
Assuming $\nu:\cj{\nu} = 1:3$ and $\delta_\text{CP} = 0$, %
the expected number of fully-contained events in the fiducial volume for the channels %
$\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$ and $\cj{\nu}_\mu \to \cj{\nu}_e$ %
are respectively \np{1643} and \np{15} in $\nu$ mode and \np{206} and \np{1183} in $\cj{\nu}$ mode, %
assuming CP conservation.
Deviations from these expected numbers could be indication of CP violation.
A preliminary study for the HK design report~\cite{Abe:2018uyc}, using a different analysis, %
estimated a significance well-above $5\,\sigma$ after ten years of data taking, as can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:hkdr}.

\section{Sensitivity to $\delta_\text{CP}$}

The sensitivity of HK to oscillation parameters is assessed by a combined fit of beam and atmospheric samples.
%are fitted together.
For the atmospheric part, SK atmospheric Monte Carlo (MC) is adapted and scaled to HK statistics.
A total of \np{2224} bins are used, divided in several two-dimensional histograms of $\log p$ and $\cos\vartheta$, %
where $\vartheta$ is the azimuthal angle.
The beam sample uses four histograms in reconstructed energy with 87 bins %
for each of the four event samples, 1~ring \mbox{$e$-like} and 1~ring $\mu$-like events in $\nu$ and $\cj{\nu}$ mode.
The event rates at the far detector are estimated with a flux prediction tuned with near detector constraints %
and smeared to obtain the reconstructed energy spectra.
The event distributions are then weighted by the corresponding oscillation probabilities for each point %
of the oscillation space, using the true neutrino energy.

The oscillation space spans four variables, $\Delta m^2_{32}$, $\sin^2 2\theta_{13}$, $\sin^2 \theta_{23}$, and %
$\delta_\text{CP}$, on a grid of respectively $13\,\times\,13\,\times\,13\,\times\,61$ points.
The CP phase is varied on the interval $[-\pi, +\pi]$, whereas the other three parameters are centred %
around the best fit points from T2K~\cite{Abe:2017vif} and reactor experiments~\cite{Bak:2018ydk, Adey:2018zwh}.
The number of events on each point of such space is compared to the number of events of a selected point, %
which is referred to as the \emph{true} set of oscillation parameters.
A $\chi^2$-test is used to test CP conservation.
The sensitivity of HK to exclude the null hypothesis, \ie~$\delta_\text{CP} = 0,\,\pm\pi$, is quantified by %
changing the \emph{true} value of $\delta_\text{CP}$ and by computing
\begin{equation}
	%\sigma = \sqrt{\qty|\chi^2_\text{true} - \min_{\delta_\text{CP} = 0,\pm\pi}|} \chi^2
	\sigma = \sqrt{\min_{\delta_\text{CP} = 0,\pm\pi}\! \chi^2\  -\,\chi^2_\text{\emph{true}}}\ ,
	\vspace{-0.3em}
\end{equation}
for each point, where $\chi^2_\text{\emph{true}}$ is evaluated at the \emph{true} point.

The test statistics of this analysis %is profiled with respect to the systematics.
is defined as a ``pull approach'' $\chi^2$~\cite{Fogli:2002pt}, in the following way
%\begin{align}
%	\chi^2_\text{tot} &=\ \chi^2_\text{obs}\ +\ \chi^2_\text{syst} \\
%	&= \overset{\text{obs}}{2 \sum_n \qty[E_n(1+\sum_j f_j^n \varepsilon_j) - O_n + O_n \log \qty(\frac{E_n(1+\sum_j f_j^n \varepsilon_j)}{O_n})]} + %
%	\overset{\text{\shortstack{syst\\ \hphantom{.}}}}{\sum_{ij} \varepsilon_i\, \rho^{-1}_{ij}\, \varepsilon_j}\ ,\notag
%\end{align}
\vspace{-0.4em}
\begin{equation}
	\chi^2_\text{tot} = %
	\overset{\text{obs}}{2 \sum_n \qty[E_n(1+\textstyle\sum f_j^n \varepsilon_j) - O_n + O_n \log \qty(\frac{E_n(1+\sum_j f_j^n \varepsilon_j)}{O_n})]} + %
	\overset{\text{\shortstack{syst\\ \hphantom{.}}}}{\sum_{ij} \varepsilon_i\, \rho^{-1}_{ij}\, \varepsilon_j}\ ,
%\vspace{-0.3em}
\end{equation}
where $O_n$ and $E_n$ are respectively the number of observed and expected events in the $n$-th bin and~$\rho^{-1}$ %
is the inverse of the correlation matrix of the systematic errors.
The systematic uncertainties are embedded in the $f_j^n$ term, which is the fractional change %
induced on the $n$-th bin by a 1\,$\sigma$ variation of the $j$-th systematic;
the amount of the shift is quantified by the ``pull'' $\varepsilon_j$ in units of the uncertainty $\sigma_j$.
For most of the systematic parameters, a linear response is assumed. %in the~MC.
This means that varying of the $j$-th systematic by a known amount, $\beta_j \to \beta_j + \varepsilon_j\sigma_j$, %
the number of expected events changes as $E_n \to E_n ( 1 + \varepsilon_j f_n^j )$.
%\begin{align*}
%	\beta_j\ \overset{\scriptstyle \text{MC}}{\longmapsto}\ E_n %
%	%\qquad \overset{\varepsilon_j \sigma_j}{\Longrightarrow} \qquad %
%	\qquad \Longrightarrow \qquad %

%\end{align*}
Certain systematic uncertainties %, such as the CCQE axial-mass scaling factor, the Fermi momentum for \tapi{16}O, %
%or some of the RPA coefficients\footnote{The Random Phase Approximation (RPA) method is applied to calculate the total cross sections %
	%of electron neutrinos on nuclei.}, 
do not present a linear behaviour for small values of $\varepsilon$ %
and they are better described by a linear interpolation between four different~$f_j^n$ histograms, computed at~$\pm1\,\sigma$ and~$\pm3\,\sigma$.
For each point of the oscillation parameter space, the $\chi^2$ is profiled %, \ie~minimised, %
with respect to the pulls. %$\varepsilon$.
This leads to a set of $j$ non-linear equations, which can be solved iteratively if the condition $\sum_j f^n_j \varepsilon_j < 1$~holds.

We adopt 67 systematics for the atmospheric sample %are adopted %
from SK atmospheric studies~\cite{Abe:2017aap}.
%An more accurate systematic study for HK is expected in the future.
For~the beam part, the T2K (2018) error model is employed~\cite{Abe:2018wpn}, %
initially uncorrelated with the atmospheric systematic set.
There are 74 uncertainties for flux and cross-section parameters, from near detector constraints. %
%divided in $25\times 2$ systematics, for each beam mode, for the four main flux components, %

for the main flux components ($\nu_e$, $\nu_\mu$, $\cj{\nu}_e$, and $\cj{\nu}_\mu$), % 
and 24 systematics for cross-section parameters.
There are also 45 uncertainties for SK detector efficiencies and Final State Interactions,
which parameterise the uncertainties on the four final state event selections at the far detector: %
1 ring $e$-like and 1 ring $\mu$-like in both $\nu$ and $\cj{\nu}$ modes.

\section{Systematic studies and conclusions}

It is expected that larger systematic errors will result in a worse sensitivity,
but certain uncertainties affect the measurement of CP violation more than others.
For example, these can be the $\nu_e$ and $\cj{\nu}_e$ charged-current cross sections, %
the transverse flux model, the pion absorption probability, %
the total energy scale in SK, or the flux alignment.
We study the impact of these selected systematics by modifying them %
one by one with respect to the nominal model and comparing the overall sensitivities to CP violation %
in these different scenarios.
Doing so, it is possible to determine which systematics have the most important repercussion on the sensitivity,
since it is fundamental to understand their effect at all phases of the experiment.

CP violation in the leptonic sector is plausible and it is also a necessary ingredient for leptogenesis.
Neutrino oscillation experiments can lead to the discovery of CP violation, and it is %
foreseen that HK will determine the value of~$\delta_\text{CP}$, %
a milestone which requires precise measurements and a deep understanding of the systematic errors.
