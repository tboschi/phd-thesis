%\chapter{Hyper-Kamiokande sensitivity to $\delta_\text{CP}$}


C and CP violation are some of the conditions required in order to generate %
an asymmetry between matter and antimatter particles, the others being %
baryon number violation and interactions out of thermal equilibrium~\cite{Sakharov:1967dj}.
%The observed baryon asymmetry in our Universe amounts to~\cite{Tanabashi:2018oca, Aghanim:2018eyx}
%\begin{equation*}
%	\eta = \frac{n_{B}}{n_\gamma}\quad,\quad \np{5.8e-10} \leq \eta \leq \np{6.6e-10}\quad\text{at}\ 95\% \text{C.L.}
%\end{equation*}
The amount of CP violation in the quark sector however is not enough %
to describe the observed baryon asymmetry within the SM~\cite{Farrar:1993hn}.
%Looking at the lepton sector,
A conceivable CP asymmetry in the lepton sector could be translated into baryogenesis %
via nonperturbative sphaleronic processes~\cite{Fukugita:1986hr}.
This mechanism, called \emph{leptogenesis}, would be allowed by the addition of %
right-handed Majorana neutrinos to the SM which can violate lepton number.
Furthermore, the extra fermions can justify light neutrino masses via a \emph{seesaw mechanism} (see \refsec{cha:mass_models}).
This elegant solution to explain the baryon asymmetry is a strong motivation %
for searches of signals of CP violation in the lepton~sector.
As three generations of leptons exist, a complex phase entirely analogous to the one %
in the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix is expected in the mixing matrix of leptons.
The CKM matrix arises from mixing of quarks in charged-current interactions (see \refeq{eq:real_quark_cc}), %
when describing the fermion fields in the mass basis.
A similar matrix that describes neutrino mass states mixing exists in the lepton sector.
It turns out that the best probe to discover CP violation is actually the study of neutrino oscillations, %
being a purely weak phenomenon in which CP--conjugate processes are well-defined.
%CP violation in the lepton sector is a plausible picture and it is also a necessary ingredient for leptogenesis.
Current neutrino oscillation experiments are paving the way to the discovery of CP violation %
and it is foreseen that next-generation experiments such as Hyper-Kamiokande (HK) %
will determine the value of~$\delta_\text{CP}$, a milestone which requires precise measurements %
and a thorough understanding of the systematic errors.

In this chapter, a study of the sensitivity of the HK experiment to oscillation parameters is presented, %
with special emphasis on $\delta_\text{CP}$.
After a review of the theory and phenomenology of CP violation in neutrino oscillation in \refsec{sec:cp_oscillation}, %
the HK experiment is introduced in \refsec{sec:hk}.
A fitting framework which combines atmospheric and beam data samples is employed for the study.
The methodology of the sensitivity studies is outlined in \refsec{sec:sensitivity}, %
together with the results from a validation test.
Finally, the full sensitivity to CP violation with the nominal systematic model is reported in \refsec{sec:syst_studies}.
Despite being very sophisticated, variations of the beam error model are considered since some systematic parameters %
are still not well understood and some early considerations are drawn at the of this chapter.


\section{CP violation in neutrino oscillations}
\label{sec:cp_oscillation}

The Dirac Lagrangian is invariant under three fundamental transformations of the fermion fields, %
and these are charge conjugation C, parity P, and time reversal T.
The spinor field $\psi$ and $\cj{\psi}$ transform under charge conjugation as
\begin{equation}
	\psi(x) \longmapsto \psi^\text{C}(x) = \xi_\text{C}\, \mathcal{C}\,\cj{\psi}^T (x) \quad , \quad
	\cj{\psi}(x) \longmapsto \cj{\psi^\text{C}}(x) = - \xi_\text{C}^*\,\psi^T (x)\,\mathcal{C}^\dagger\ ,
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{C}$ is the charge conjugation operator.
The application of the transformation twice returns the same initial field, %
so $\xi_\text{C}$ must be a unitary phase, i.e.\  $\abs{\xi_\text{C}}^2 = 1$. 
The parity transformation, instead, inverts spatial coordinates and acts on spinor fields as
\begin{equation}
	\psi(x) \longmapsto \psi^\text{P}(x') = \xi_\text{P}\, \gamma^0 \,\psi(x) \quad , \quad
	\cj{\psi}(x) \longmapsto \cj{\psi^\text{P}}(x') = \xi_\text{P}^*\,\cj{\psi}(x)\,\gamma^0\ .
\end{equation}
With two consecutive parity transformations the coordinate system is restored and therefore %
the unitary phase $\xi_\text{P}$ is constrained to be $\pm1$ or $\pm i$.
Vector and axial covariants, respectively $\cj{\psi}_a \gamma^\mu \psi_b$ and $\cj{\psi}_a \gamma^\mu \gamma^5 \psi_b$, %
transforms oppositely under charge conjugation and spatial inversion, unless $a = b$, and so the $V-A$ structure %
of weak interactions (see \refeqs{eq:lepton_cc}{eq:lepton_nc}) violates C and P individually.

The combined transformation of charge conjugation and parity, referred to as CP transformation, %
is applied to the fields as
\begin{equation}
	\psi(x) \longmapsto \psi^\text{CP}(x) = -\xi_\text{CP}\, \mathcal{C}\,\psi^* (x) \ , \quad
	\cj{\psi}(x) \longmapsto \cj{\psi^\text{CP}}(x) = - \xi_\text{CP}^*\,\psi^T (x)\,\mathcal{C}^\dagger \gamma^0\ ,
\end{equation}
where the CP phase $\xi_\text{CP}$ is also unitary.
A CP transformation presents the same coefficient on vector and axial bilinear terms, %
which means that $V-A$ bilinears are in principle invariant under CP.
The weak interactions of the SM are therefore CP--symmetric if the phase of the $W$ boson is chosen accordingly.
In the case of generation mixing, the invariance in the quark sector is obtained when
\begin{equation}
	j^\mu_\text{CC, Q} W_\mu \longmapsto \qty(j^\mu_\text{CC, Q} W_\mu)^\dagger \quad %
	\Leftrightarrow \quad %
	- \xi_W \bs{\xi}_D V^T \bs{\xi}_U^\dagger = V^\dagger\ ,
\end{equation}
where the CP phases for the quarks have been promoted into diagonal matrices $\bs{\xi}_{D, U}$, %
and $V$ is the CKM matrix.
The Lagrangian must be a real scalar, hence by conjugating the conditions in the equation above %
it follows that $\bs{\xi}_{D, U}^\dagger = \bs{\xi}_{D, U}^{-1}$ and that the diagonal matrices %
are unitary, or
\begin{equation}
	\bs{\xi}_{D,U} = e^{i \xi_{\delta,\upsilon}}\ ,
\end{equation}
where the indices $\delta$ and $\upsilon$ refer respectively to down and up quarks.
The condition for CP invariance now becomes 
\begin{equation}
	e^{i \xi_\upsilon}\, V_{\upsilon \delta} e^{-i \xi_\delta} = V_{\upsilon \delta}^*\ .
\end{equation}
This condition cannot be satisfied with an arbitrary choice of the CP phases for the quark fields %
if the mixing matrix is not real, or $V = V^*$.

It follows from the discussion above that if the mixing matrix presents one or more nonzero complex phases, %
the quark charged-current weak interactions break the CP symmetry of the SM Lagrangian.
The violation of CP is indeed a known process in the quark sector of the standard model.
It has been extensively observed~\cite{Christenson:1964fg,Aubert:2001sp, Abe:2001xe, Aaij:2013iua, Aaij:2019kcg}, %
giving a clear evidence that the CKM matrix is complex.
The symmetry is restored when considering the time reversal symmetry: %
consecutive transformation of C, P, and T leave invariant all possible covariant bilinears, in accordance with %
the \emph{CPT theorem}.

The Pontecorvo--Maki--Nakagawa--Sakata (PMNS) matrix is usually parameterised as in \refeq{eq:pmns} %
with the addition of two more phases if the neutrino is Majorana.
The PMNS matrix relates flavour states $\alpha = e, \mu, \tau$ with mass eigenstates $i = 1, 2, 3$  %
as $\ket{\nu_\alpha} = \sum_i U^*_{\alpha i} \ket{\nu_i}$, from which %
the probability of flavour oscillation in vacuum can be derived (see \refeq{eq:oscillation_probability}).
%%$P(\nu_\alpha \to \nu_\beta)$ is computed as $\qty|\mel{\nu_\alpha}{e^{-i\mathcal{H}t}}{\nu_\beta}|^2$ %
%\vspace{-0.4em}
%\begin{equation}
%	P(\nu_\alpha \to \nu_\beta) \equiv \qty|\mel{\nu_\alpha}{e^{-i\mathcal{H}t}}{\nu_\beta}| ^2 = %
%	\sum_{ij} U_{i\alpha}^* U_{\beta i} U_{\alpha j} U_{j\beta}^* %
%	\exp \qty(-i \frac{\Delta m_{ij}^2 L}{2 E})\ ,
%\vspace{-0.4em}
%\end{equation}
%where $\mathcal{H}$ is the Hamiltonian, $t \simeq L$ and $\Delta m^2_{ij} = m_i^2 - m_j^2$, %
%and it depends on the physical angles and phases of the PMNS matrix, %
%with the exception of the Majorana phases.
The CP--conjugate of a neutrino with negative helicity is an antineutrino with positive helicity %
which, in terms of neutrino oscillations, means transforming the $\nu_\alpha \to \nu_\beta$ oscillation channel %
into the $\cj{\nu}_\alpha \to \cj{\nu}_\beta$ channel.
The violation of CP in neutrino oscillation can be quantified by the asymmetry in oscillation probabilities %
between neutrinos and antineutrinos which in vacuum reads as
%\vspace{-0.5em}
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:asymmetry}
	A^\text{CP}_{\alpha\beta} = P(\nu_\alpha \to \nu_\beta) - P(\cj{\nu}_\alpha \to \cj{\nu}_\beta) = %
	4 \sum_{i>j}\imaginary\qty[U_{i\alpha}^* U_{\beta i} U_{\alpha j} U_{j \beta}^*] \sin\qty(\frac{\Delta m_{ij}^2 L}{2E})\ .
%\vspace{-0.3em}
\end{equation}
%with $t \simeq L$ and $\Delta m^2_{ij} = m_i^2 - m_j^2$.
The quartic product $U_{i\alpha}^* U_{\beta i} U_{\alpha j} U_{j \beta}^*$ %
is invariant under a reparameterisation of the mixing matrix being a physical observable %
and it is complex only if $\alpha\neq\beta$ and $i \neq j$.
For this reason, CP violation can only be measured in ``appearance'' channels.
The imaginary part of the quartic products is antisymmetric on the indices $\alpha,\beta$ and $i, j$.
%and %
%they are all equal up to a sign.
Starting from the unitarity of the mixing matrix, for example $U\,U^\dagger = 1$, the following relation holds:
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{i=1}^3 U_{\alpha i} U_{\beta i}^* = \delta_{\alpha\beta}\ .
\end{equation}
Multiplying it by $U_{\alpha j}^* U_{\beta j}$, the expression can be written as
\begin{equation}
	|U_{\alpha j}|^2 |U_{\beta j}|^2 + \sum_{i\neq j} U_{\alpha i} U_{\beta j} U_{\beta i}^* U_{\alpha j}^* = %
		\delta_{\alpha\beta} |U_{\alpha j}|^2\ .
\end{equation}
Taking the imaginary part of left-hand and right-hand sides of the equation results into 
\begin{equation}
	\sum_{\alpha \neq \beta} \imaginary\qty[U_{\alpha i} U_{\beta j} U_{\beta i}^* U_{\beta j}^*] = 0\ .
\end{equation}
The above condition together with the antisymmetry of the indices reveals that the quartic products are all equal up to a sign.
This value is called \emph{Jarlskog invariant}.
Using the parametrisation of the PMNS matrix in Eq.~\ref{eq:pmns}, %
this invariant is usually expressed in terms of the mixing angles as~\cite{Jarlskog:1985ht}
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:jarlskog}
	J = \imaginary\qty[U_{\mu 3} U_{e 2} U_{\mu 2}^* U_{e 3}^*] = %
	    \frac{1}{8} \cos\theta_{13} \sin(2\theta_{12}) \sin(2\theta_{13}) \sin(2\theta_{23}) \sin \delta_\text{CP}\ .
\end{equation}

	\label{fig:baseball}
\end{figure}

The main channel of interest for long baseline experiments (LBL) is the appearance channel $\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$.
This is for two main reasons: the attainable flux in accelerator experiments is principally composed of muon neutrinos, %
and the achieved energies are not enough to produce $\tau$ leptons at the detection site.
Putting together \refeqs{eq:asymmetry}{eq:jarlskog}, the asymmetry for this channel looks like
\begin{equation}
%\begin{align}
%	\mathcal{A}_{\mu e}^\text{CP} =&\ \frac{1}{2} \cos\theta_{13} \sin(2\theta_{12}) %
%		\sin(2\theta_{13}) \sin(2\theta_{23}) \sin \delta_\text{CP} \notag \\
%		&\times \qty[\sin \Delta_{12} - \sin \Delta_{13} + \sin \Delta_{23}] \notag \\
	\mathcal{A}_{\mu e}^\text{CP} = 4\,J\  \qty[\sin \Delta_{12} - \sin \Delta_{13} + \sin \Delta_{23}]\ ,
%\end{align}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta_{ij} = \flatfrac{\Delta m_{ij}^2 L }{4 E}$,
even though the CP asymmetries for each channel are all equal up to a sign,
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{A}_{\mu e} = \mathcal{A}_{\tau \mu} = \mathcal{A}_{e \tau} = %
	- \mathcal{A}_{e \mu} = - \mathcal{A}_{\mu \tau} = - \mathcal{A}_{\tau e}  \ .
\end{equation}
Let us recall the hierarchy of the squared mass differences:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:hierarchy}
	\Delta m^2_\text{sol} = \Delta m^2_{21} \ll \Delta m^2_\text{atm} = |\Delta m^2_{31}|\ .
\end{equation}
The typical energies and baselines of LBL experiments are such that
\begin{equation}
	\frac{|\Delta m_{31}^2|}{2} \frac{L}{E} \sim \pi\ ,
\end{equation}
and so in this regime the atmospheric mass difference dominates, meaning that the oscillation probability in vacuum %
can be well-approximated by an effective two-flavour scenario
\begin{equation}
	P(\nu_\alpha \to \nu_\beta) = \sin^2 2\theta_\text{eff}\, \sin^2\qty(\frac{\Delta m^2_{31} L}{4E})\ ,
\end{equation}
for $\alpha \neq \beta$.
As the mixing in the two-flavour limit can be expressed by means of a single angle, %
it follows that the effective mixing angle $\theta_\text{eff}$ is invariant under CP and %
so the effective asymmetry vanishes, $\mathcal{A}^\text{eff}_{\alpha \beta} = 0$.
The data collected by LBL experiments to date does not provide sufficient statistics to be sensitive %
to the effects of $\Delta m_{21}^2$ and the measured neutrino--antineutrino asymmetries cannot be constrained, %
even though good significance was recently reached by the T2K experiment~\cite{Abe:2019vii}.
%(see for example \refref{Abe:2018wpn}).Abe:2019vii
Remaining in the limit of \refeq{eq:hierarchy}, the evolution equation including matter effects %
receives helpful cancellations and it reads
\begin{equation}
	i \dv{}{x} \mqty(\psi_{\alpha 1} \\ \psi_{\alpha 2} \\ \psi_{\alpha 3}) =
		\frac{1}{2E} \mqty (s_{13}^2 \Delta m_{31}^2 + A_\text{CC} & 0 & c_{13} s_{13} \Delta m_{31}^2 \\
				    0				 & 0 &  0			     \\
				    c_{13} s_{13} \Delta m_{31}^2 & 0 & c_{13}^2 \Delta m_{31}^2) %
				    \mqty(\psi_{\alpha 1} \\ \psi_{\alpha 2} \\ \psi_{\alpha 3})\ .
\end{equation}
It is important to observe that the equation depends only on the mixing angle $\theta_{13}$, %
but it is independent of $\delta_\text{CP}$.
If the experiment is only sensitive to $\Delta m_{31}^2$, an effective two-neutrino mixing is in place, %
even considering matter effects. 
%Hence, CP violation is not observable in experiments which are 
%just by taking in account oscillations in matter, as well as in vacuum. ?
%This is understandable because the limit given by the approximation of \refeq{eq:hierarchy} %
%corresponds to an effective two-flavour oscillation: with two generations only one angle is sufficient to %
%describe neutrino mixing.
However, the oscillation probabilities of neutrinos and antineutrinos in matter are not the same %
because the medium is not CP--invariant and so it induces CP violation in the oscillation probabilities %
via the matter potential $A_\text{CC}$.
The effect of $\delta_\text{CP}$ and of matter effects on the asymmetry of \refeq{eq:asymmetry} %
are visualised in two different fashions in \reffig{fig:baseball}: %
one graph shows the probabilities of neutrinos and antineutrinos against each other %
evidencing that these two are different for $\delta_\text{CP} \neq 0, \pm\pi$; the other figure %
shows the asymmetry as a function of $\delta_\text{CP}$.

\end{align}
where $s_{ij} = \sin \theta_{ij}$, $c_{ij} = \cos\theta_{ij}$,
and $a = 2\sqrt{2} G_F\,n_e\,E$ embeds matter effect with $n_e$ the electron density of the medium.
\fi


Given the parametrisation in Eq.~\ref{eq:pmns}, %
it is clear that the asymmetry is not measurable if the phase is trivial, \ie~$\delta_\text{CP} = 0$~or~$\pm \pi$, %
or if $\theta_{13}$ is vanishing.
From a model building point of view, however, a successful leptogenesis requires the parameters to satisfy %
$\qty|\sin\theta_{13} \sin\delta_\text{CP}| \gtrsim 0.09$
%\begin{equation}
%	\label{eq:leptogenesis}
%	\qty|\sin\theta_{13} \sin\delta_\text{CP}| \gtrsim 0.09\ ,
%\end{equation}
when the Majorana phases are vanishing~\cite{Pascoli:2006ci}.
The value of $\theta_{13}$ has been measured to be nonzero~\cite{Abe:2011sj,Abe:2011fz,An:2012eh,Ahn:2012nd} %
and for this reason it is expected that ongoing and future generation neutrino experiments %
will constrain the value of $\delta_\text{CP}$.


\section{Hyper-Kamiokande experiment}
\label{sec:hk}

\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{pics/hkonlytank.png}
	\caption[Views of the Hyper-Kamiokande experiment]{Cut-views of the Hyper-Kamiokande experiment.}
	\label{fig:hkdr}
\end{figure}

Hyper-Kamiokande (HK)~\cite{Abe:2018uyc} will be the next-generation water Cherenkov detector, %
studying neutrino interactions and searching for nucleon decays with the ring-imaging technique.
The detector will be located in the Tochibora mine, under Mt.\ Nijugo in the Gifu Prefecture, Japan, 
just 8\,km south from Super-Kamiokande.
At this location, the rock overburden is equivalent to 1750\,m.w.e.
%superseding its predecessor, Super-Kamiokande (SK).
%, the rare interactions of neutrinos can be detected, %
%as well as the possible spontaneous decay of nucleons.
The design of HK is similar to the one of SK (see \refsec{sec:sk}), with size being the biggest difference.
A possible schematic of the detector is shown in \reffig{fig:hkdr}.
The cylindrical tank of HK will be 72\,m high and 68\,m in diameter, with a fiducial volume of 188.4\,kton (total volume 257.8\,kton), %
around 8.4 times the fiducial volume of SK.
The photocoverage of the inner detector region will be 40\,\%, the same of SK, %
but it translates to roughly forty thousand photomultipliers (PMTs).
New 20'' box and line PMTs will be employed, with improved charge and timing resolution, %
and an increased quantum efficiency which is almost twice as much that of the previous generation of PMTs.
The new photosensors must also have a high pressure tolerance to be used at a depth of 60\,m and more of water.
A study for implementing multi PMT modules, each containing 23 3'' PMT, is also being carried out.
%The detector will be located underground at Kamioka mine in Gifu Prefecture, %
%with an overburden of approximately 650 meters or more of rock, which is equivalent to \np{1750} meters or more of water.
As SK, the new detector will have an outer detector which is just 1\,m wide and instrumented with 3'' PMTs.
Thanks to incredible statistics and cutting edge resolutions, HK will be capable of a vast variety of physics studies, %
from accelerator and atmospheric neutrinos to solar and supernova neutrinos.
Besides detecting proton decay, the main goal of HK is to measure~$\delta_\text{CP}$ and constrain the other oscillation parameters %
with high precision.
This is best achieved by studying accelerator neutrinos which allow a higher control of the experimental variables, %
and to this end the possibility of installing a second detector in Korea %
at the secondary oscillation peak is being investigated by the collaboration.

HK will be located 295\,km away from the T2K target and at $2.5^\circ$ off-axis with respect to the beamline.
The neutrino beam is generated by a 30\,GeV proton beam in the way described in \refsec{sec:nu_acc}.
By selecting the direction of the horn's current, an almost pure muon neutrino (or antineutrino) beam is obtained, peaking at 600\,MeV.
The accelerator facility at J-PARC will undergo a planned upgrade to increase the beam power to 1.3\,MW, %
before HK starts operation.
The T2K near detector system, consisting of the detectors ND280 ($2.5^\circ$ off-axis) and INGRID (on-axis)~\cite{Abe:2011ks}, %
will be refurbished and a new near detector, called \emph{Intermediate Water Cherenkov Detector}, possibly gadolinium-loaded, %
will be located around 1\,km from the target.
HK will take data for ten years, collecting a total of \np{2.7e22} protons on target (POT), %
divided between $\nu$ and $\cj{\nu}$ beam modes.
Studies have shown that CP violation discovery is not very sensitive to POT allocation between the two modes~\cite{Abe:2018uyc}.
Assuming a POT ratio $\nu:\cj{\nu} = 1:3$ and CP conservation, %
the expected number of fully-contained events in the fiducial volume for the channels %
$\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$ and $\cj{\nu}_\mu \to \cj{\nu}_e$ %
are respectively \np{1643} and \np{15} in $\nu$ mode and \np{206} and \np{1183} in $\cj{\nu}$ mode.
Deviations from these expected numbers could be an indication of CP violation.
%A preliminary study for the HK design report~\cite{Abe:2018uyc}, using a different analysis, %
%estimated a significance well-above $5\,\sigma$ after ten years of data taking, as can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:hkdr}.
The project has been recently approved by the Japanese government and data taking is expected to start in 2027.

%The uncertainty of the Earth’s density between Tokai and Kamioka is estimated to be at most 6\% [181].
%Because the matter effect contribution to the total $\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$ appearance probability is %
%less than 10\% for 295km baseline, the uncertainty from the matter density is estimated to be less
%than 0.6\% and neglected in the following analysis.


\section{Sensitivity studies}
\label{sec:sensitivity}

At any stage of the experiment it is important to asses the impact of systematic errors on the total sensitivity of HK.
%One of the main goal is to constrain with high precision oscillation parameters, especially $\delta_\text{CP}$ %
%and the $\theta_{23}$ octant.
Even if real data is not available, it is possible to understand whether the planned volume of data to be collected %
has enough constraining power to achieve the target precision.
The oscillation and systematic parameters are input to a Monte Carlo simulation %
to build the expected distribution of events.
This expected data is then compared to simulated ``observed data'', which is created by selecting %
a combination of oscillation parameters in order to mimic the real distributions of events that will be eventually collected.
Scanning over the oscillation parameters, the resolution of HK to oscillation parameters and, more importantly, %
the influence of the systematic uncertainties can be studied.
To this end, a fitting framework capable of performing a simultaneous study of beam and atmospheric samples was employed.

For the study, SK atmospheric Monte Carlo (MC) data are adapted and scaled to HK fiducial volume in order to form the atmospheric sample.
The events are then classified and binned into several two-dimensional histograms of $\log p$ and $\cos\vartheta$, %
where $p$ and $\vartheta$ are respectively the momentum and the azimuthal angle of the reconstructed charged lepton.
The histograms are summarised in~\reftab{tab:atmo_samples} where they are categorised as fully-contained (FC), %
partially-contained (PC), or upward-going muons (UP-$\mu$) events~\cite{Jiang:2019xwn}.
There are a total of \np{2224} bins employed for the atmospheric sample.

The beam sample is instead created using a far detector flux prediction which is explained in \refsec{sec:prediction}.
From the flux prediction, fully-contained candidate events in the fiducial volume are grouped %
as appearance signals, i.e.\ $\nu_\mu\to\nu_e$ and $\cj{\nu}_\mu\to\cj{\nu}_e$, %
and background events from disappearance channels.
Signal and background distributions in true energy (98 bins) undergo event selection criteria %
to obtain the distributions in reconstructed energy (87 bins) for the four event samples: %
one ring $e$-like in $\nu$-mode; %
one ring $\mu$-like in $\nu$-mode; %
one ring $e$-like in $\cj{\nu}$-mode; %
one ring $\mu$-like in $\cj{\nu}$-mode.
A set of 2D smearing matrices, produced by the T2K fitting framework VALOR~\cite{VALOR}, %
simulates and replaces the correct event selection process, including tuning of the flux with near detector constraints.
These smearing matrices are provided for all samples, acting on signal (CCQE and CCnQE) %
and background (CCQE, CCnQE, and NC) distributions.
The one ring $e$-like with one electron decay sample, included in T2K analyses, is not considered in this study.

Both the atmospheric and beam distributions are weighted by the corresponding oscillation probabilities.
The oscillation parameters are scanned over the space defined by the four variables %
\begin{equation}
	\Delta m^2_{32} \times \sin^2 2\theta_{13} \times \sin^2 \theta_{23} \times \delta_\text{CP}
\end{equation}
on a grid of respectively $13\,\times\,13\,\times\,19\,\times\,61$ points.
The solar squared mass difference and the solar angle $\theta_{12}$ are fixed.
Apart from $\delta_\text{CP}$ which is scanned over all possible values, %
the intervals for the other parameters are built around ``Asimov A'', the best fit point used by T2K %
for Asimov and fake data studies~\cite{Abe:2018wpn} .
The details of the oscillation space are listed in \reftab{tab:asimovA}.
For the atmospheric squared mass difference and $\sin^2 2\theta_{13}$, the range is chosen such that it covers %
a $[-3\,\sigma, +3\,\sigma]$ interval, where $\sigma$ is the error from the Asimov A set; %
the range for $\sin^2\theta_{23}$ spans over $[-6\,\sigma, +3\,\sigma]$ so that both octants are covered symmetrically.
%Reactor experiments~\cite{Bak:2018ydk, Adey:2018zwh}.
At each point of this space, the event distributions are weighted with the correct oscillation probability %
for appearance or disappearance channels.
The Asimov A point is chosen to be the \emph{true} combination of oscillation parameters %
to perform sensitivity studies using a $\chi^2$-test statistic.
It is possible to define the exclusion regions for CP conservation by changing the \emph{true} value of the CP phase
and by comparing the $\chi^2$ at any value of $\delta_\text{CP}$ with the $\chi^2$ computed at %
the null hypothesis, i.e.\ CP conservation or $\delta_\text{CP} = 0, \pm\pi$.
The exclusion sensitivity as a function of \emph{true} $\delta_\text{CP}$ %
is quantified by %
\begin{equation}
	\sigma = \sqrt{\min_{\delta_\text{CP} = 0,\pm\pi}\! \chi^2\  -\,\chi^2_\text{\emph{true}}}\ ,
\end{equation}
where $\chi^2_\text{\emph{true}}$ is evaluated at the \emph{true} point and matches the best fit value.
The normal hierarchy is assumed to be known, except where stated.



\subsection{Test statistic}
\label{sec:x2}

Let us define the likelihood
\begin{equation}
	\mathfrak{L}(E_n, O_n) = \prod_n \frac{e^{-E_n} E_n^{O_n}}{O_n!}\ ,
\end{equation}
where $O_n$ and $E_n$ are respectively the number of observed and expected events in the $n$-th bin, %
which are built using a specific combination of oscillation parameters 
\begin{equation}
	\Theta \equiv (\Delta m^2_{32}, \sin^2 2\theta_{13}, \sin^2 \theta_{23}, \delta_\text{CP})\ .
\end{equation}
The expected events are defined by a prediction at the far detector weighted by the oscillation probabilities %
for parameters $\Theta$, and since there is no real data yet the ``observed'' events are also given by %
a prediction weighted with the \emph{true} oscillation point, $\Theta_\text{true}$.
%and the product runs over the total number of bins.
The $\chi^2$ is hence the following log-likelihood ratio
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:log_ratio}
	\chi^2(\Theta) = -2 \log \qty[\frac{\mathfrak{L}(E_n, O_n)}{\mathfrak{L}(O_n, O_n)}] =
		2 \sum_n \qty[E_n - O_n + O_n \log \qty(\frac{O_n}{E_n})]\ ,
\end{equation}
which is modified according to the ``pull approach'' $\chi^2$~\cite{Fogli:2002pt}: %
the parameters $\bs{\varepsilon} = \{\varepsilon_j\}$ are introduced %
to account for systematic uncertainties by replacing
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:pull}
	E_n\ \longrightarrow\ E_n\,\qty(1 + \textstyle\sum_j f_j^n \varepsilon_j)\ ,
\end{equation}
where the index $j$ runs over the systematic parameters.
A penalty term that includes variances and covariances of such parameters is added to the likelihood, %
using the inverse of the correlation matrix of the systematic errors, $\rho^{-1}$.
With all these adjustments included, the $\chi^2$ becomes
%\begin{align}
%	\chi^2_\text{tot} &=\ \chi^2_\text{obs}\ +\ \chi^2_\text{syst} \notag\\
%	&= \overset{\text{obs}}{2 \sum_n \qty[E_n(1+{\textstyle\sum_j f_j^n \varepsilon_j}) - O_n + O_n \log \qty(\frac{E_n(1+\sum_j f_j^n \varepsilon_j)}{O_n})]} + %
%	\overset{\text{\shortstack{syst\\ \hphantom{.}}}}{\sum_{ij} \varepsilon_i\, \rho^{-1}_{ij}\, \varepsilon_j}\ ,
%\end{align}
\begin{align}
	\chi^2(\Theta;\bs{\varepsilon})  =&\ 2 \sum_n \qty[E_n(1+{\textstyle\sum_j f_j^n \varepsilon_j}) - O_n + %
		O_n \log \qty(\frac{O_n}{E_n(1+\sum_j f_j^n \varepsilon_j)})] %\notag \\
		+ \sum_{ij} \varepsilon_i\, \rho^{-1}_{ij}\, \varepsilon_j\ .
	\label{eq:chi2}
\end{align}
The effect of the systematic uncertainties on the event distributions are embedded in the $f_j^n$ parameters, %
defined as the fractional change induced on the $n$-th bin by a 1\,$\sigma$ variation of the $j$-th systematic.
The amount of change is therefore parameterised by the $\varepsilon_j$ variables in units of the uncertainty $\sigma_j$.
However, being $\rho$ the correlation matrix, the $\varepsilon_j$ are promoted to embody the systematic uncertainties.
Once the observed sample is defined, the oscillation parameters $\Theta$ are scanned over the oscillation %
space defined in \reftab{tab:asimovA} to estimate the expected events; finally, the $\chi^2$ is profiled %
with respect to the parameters~$\bs{\varepsilon}$:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:chi2_min}
	\chi^2(\Theta) = \min_{\bs{\varepsilon}}\, \qty\Big[\,\chi^2(\Theta;\bs{\varepsilon})\,]\ .
\end{equation}
Fixing the combination $\Theta$ and dropping it from the notation, %
the minimisation of the $\chi^2$ leads to the following set of $j$ nonlinear equations %,
\begin{equation}
	\pdv{\chi^2}{\varepsilon_j} (\bs{\varepsilon}) = 0\ 
\end{equation}
which can be solved iteratively if the condition $\sum_j f^n_j \varepsilon_j < 1$~holds.
The system can then be solved with the Gauss-Newton's method by finding the Hessian of the $\chi^2$.
This gives a linear system, which can be solved iteratively until convergence on $\varepsilon_j$ is achieved:
%The algorithm is stabilised by means of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm
\begin{equation}
	\pdv{\chi^2(\bs{\varepsilon}^{(n)})}{\varepsilon_k}{\varepsilon_j} %
	\cdot \qty(\varepsilon_j^{(n+1)} - \varepsilon_j^{(n)}) = %
	-\pdv{\chi^2(\bs{\varepsilon}^{(n)})}{\varepsilon_k}\ ,
\end{equation}
with $(n)$ the iteration index.
The Gauss-Newton's algorithm can sometimes be unstable, especially with a large number of parameters, %
due to its fast convergence.
The algorithm is typically improved by adopting the Lavenberg-Marquardt method~\cite{Levenberg_1944, Marquardt_1963} %
which modifies the Hessian and the equations become
\begin{equation}
	\qty[\pdv{\chi^2(\bs{\varepsilon}^{(n)})}{\varepsilon_k}{\varepsilon_j} %
	+ \lambda \max \qty(\text{diag} \pdv{\chi^2(\bs{\varepsilon}^{(n)})}{\varepsilon_k}{\varepsilon_j}) \mathbb{1}]
	\cdot \qty(\varepsilon_j^{(n+1)} - \varepsilon_j^{(n)}) = %
	-\pdv{\chi^2(\bs{\varepsilon}^{(n)})}{\varepsilon_k}\ .
\end{equation}
The parameter $\lambda$ is chosen dynamically: if the cost function $\chi^2$ decreases %
after an iteration step, then $\lambda$ is reduced; otherwise $\lambda$ is increased and the step recomputed.
In the limit $\lambda \to 0$, the algorithm approximates the Gauss-Newton's method and its fast convergence.
When $\lambda$ is large, the linear system resembles a gradient descent with small steps of the order of $\lambda^{-1}$, %
but with a more stable convergence.
A ``delayed-gratification scheme'' is adopted for $\lambda$~\cite{Transtrum2012}, using an initial value of $\lambda^{(0)} = 1$ and finding %
an optimal increment and decrement of respectively $\lambda^{(n+1)} = 5\,\lambda^{(n)}$ and $\lambda^{(n+1)} = \lambda^{(n)} / 10$.

To account for future constraints from other experiments, a Gaussian penalty term is added %
to the minimised value of $\chi^2$ from \refeq{eq:chi2_min}
\begin{equation}
	\chi^2_\text{penalty} = \frac{(\Theta - \hat{\Theta})^2}{\sigma_\Theta^2}\ .
\end{equation}
In this analysis, only a penalty on the parameter $\theta_{13}$ is considered, %
which is predicted to be constrained to $\sigma(\sin^2 2\theta_{13}) = 0.005$ by future measurements of reactor experiments.

For most of the systematic parameters, a linear response is assumed in the~MC.
This means that varying the $j$-th systematic by a known amount, $\beta_j \to \beta_j + \varepsilon_j\sigma_j$ %
the number of expected events changes accordingly:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:linear}
	\beta_j\ \overset{\scriptstyle \text{MC}}{\longmapsto}\ E_n %
	%\qquad \overset{\varepsilon_j \sigma_j}{\Longrightarrow} \qquad %
	\qquad \Longrightarrow \qquad %
	\beta_j + \varepsilon_j\sigma_j\ \overset{\text{MC}}{\longmapsto}\ E_n ( 1 + \varepsilon_j f_n ^j )\ .
	%&\hspace{0.4em}\text{\scriptsize MC} \\
	%\text{\scriptsize MC\ :} \hspace{1em} \Downarrow & \hspace{3.5em} \Downarrow	\\	
\end{equation}
Certain systematic uncertainties, such as the CCQE axial-mass scaling factor, the Fermi momentum for \tapi{16}O, %
or some of the RPA coefficients, %
%\footnote{The Random Phase Approximation (RPA) method is applied to calculate the total cross-sections %
	%of electron neutrinos on nuclei.}, 
do not present a linear behaviour for small values of $\varepsilon$ %
and they are better described by a four-point linear interpolation of different~$f_j^n$ histograms, %
computed at~$\pm1\,\sigma$ and~$\pm3\,\sigma$ variations of the systematic parameter.

The simulation of the HK detector heavily relies on the techniques established by the SK and T2K collaborations.
Neutrinos interactions are generated using NEUT~\cite{Hayato:2002sd}, also employed in SK and T2K.
The response of the detector is simulated using the SK-IV full Monte Carlo simulation, which uses the GEANT3~\cite{Brun:1994aa}.
Events are reconstructed with the SK reconstruction software, which gives a realistic estimate of the HK performance.
The criteria to select neutrino candidates in MC simulations follows a similar prescription to the one used in SK.
Only fully contained events within the inner detector are considered, provided that the reconstructed vertex %
is more than 1.5\,m away from the ID walls (fiducial volume) and that the collected charge from the PMTs, $E_\text{vis}$, %
amounts to an energy greater than 30\,MeV.
The purity of the data sample is controlled by requiring the detection of a single Cherenkov ring.
In this way, the chance of selecting only CCQE events is enhanced.
The neutrino energy is reconstructed from the energy of the final state charged lepton and %
the angle between the neutrino beam and the charged lepton direction, applying \refeq{eq:e_reco}.
Electron-flavour events are selected by requiring an $e$-like ring, deposited energy %
in the range $100\,\text{MeV} < E_\text{vis} < 1.25\,\text{GeV}$, %
and no decay electron associated to the event, typical of a muon decay.
The muon sample is built by requiring a $\mu$-like ring, a reconstructed muon momentum greater than $200$\,MeV %
and the presence of the electron from the Michel decay of the muon.
The simulation is run assuming an integrated beam power of 13\,MW, corresponding to \np{2.7e22}\,POT %
collected over 10 years with a 30\,GeV proton beam.
The proportion between the amount of data collected in neutrino and antineutrino modes is set to $\nu : \cj{\nu} = 1:3$.
The ratio is chosen in order to have similar number of events in the $\nu$- and $\cj{\nu}$-mode samples.
The reconstructed spectra from the simulations are shown in \reffigs{fig:reco_spectra_e}{fig:reco_spectra_mu} %
where two different oscillation parameter combinations are compared to illustrate the effect of neutrino oscillation;
the contributions from different oscillation channels to the overall distributions are also highlighted.




\subsection{Validation of the fitter}
\label{sec:nuenorm}

Before employing the full systematic model, the fitting framework is validated with %
a special systematic set for the beam sample.
It is composed of just two systematics: the $\nu_e$ and the $\cj{\nu}_e$ CC cross-section uncertainties.
These two errors are implemented twice, either as correlated or as anticorrelated, %
and they are tested at different values (1\%, 2\%, 3\%, 4\%, and 5\%) for a total of ten combinations.
The correlation matrices used are simply
\begin{equation}
	\rho = \mqty(\hphantom{-}1 & \hphantom{-}1 \\ \hphantom{-}1 & \hphantom{-}1) \quad\text{and}\quad
	\rho = \mqty(\hphantom{-}1 & -1 \\ -1 & \hphantom{-}1) \ ,
\end{equation}
but they are both singular and not invertible.
A small offset of \np{e-5} is added to off-diagonal terms to allow the calculation of the $\chi^2$.
Due to the definition of the $\chi^2$ in \refeq{eq:chi2}, %
the difference between fits with the same relative error lies in the correlation matrix, %
whereas at fixed correlation the effect of the systematics on the likelihood is given by the $1\,\sigma$ histograms.

In \reffig{fig:nuenorm_prediction}, the event distributions of the one ring %
$e$-like samples (previously presented in \reffig{fig:reco_spectra_e}) are shown with %
the $\nu_e$ and the $\cj{\nu_e}$ CC cross-section uncertainties applied at 1$\sigma$ for each %
of the five magnitude levels.
It can be seen that the effect of the systematic errors is linear with the relative error.
The $\chi^2$ profiles with respect to $\Delta m_{32}^2$, $\sin^2 2\theta_{13}$, and $\sin^2 \theta_{23}$ are
shown in \reffig{fig:nuenorm_mass_angles} for correlated and anticorrelated errors, %
and a contour plot between $\Delta m_{32}^2$ and $\sin^2 \theta_{23}$ is reported in \reffig{fig:nuenorm_sensitivity}.
These parameters are not significantly sensitive to the correlation between the two systematic uncertainties.
The contour levels of the $\chi^2$ versus $\Delta m_{32}^2$ and $\sin^2 \theta_{23}$ %
show that at the $1\,\sigma$ level of confidence the determination of the $\theta_{23}$ octant %
is slowly lost as the uncertainty increases.
On the other hand, the CP phase is the parameter which shows more difference between correlation and anticorrelation, %
as it can be seen from the remaining panels of \reffig{fig:nuenorm_sensitivity}.
When the two CC cross-sections are anticorrelated, the increment of one error brings about the decrement of the other.
This results in an effective fluctuation of the number of events, exhibiting a CP violation--like phenomenon.
The importance of this study set can also be appreciated from the exclusion of CP conservation, from \reffig{fig:nuenorm_sensitivity}.
A large systematic uncertainty of anticorrelated cross-section parameters can therefore only aggravate the %
overall sensitivity to $\delta_\text{CP}$.
On the other hand, different values of correlated systematics do not degrade the exclusion power to CP conservation.




\section{Systematic studies}
\label{sec:syst_studies}

It is expected that larger systematic uncertainties will result in a worse sensitivity,
but certain errors affect the measurement of the oscillation parameters more than others.
For example, these can be the uncertainties on $\nu_e$ and $\cj{\nu}_e$ charged-current cross-sections, %
the transverse flux model, the pion absorption probability, the energy scale of the far detector, or the flux alignment.
The impact of some selected systematics is studied by modifying the nominal systematic model %
and analysing the overall predicted sensitivity of the experiment in these different scenarios.
Doing so, it is possible to determine which systematics have the most important repercussion on the sensitivity,
since it is fundamental to understand their effect at all phases of the experiment.


\subsection{Systematic model}
\label{sec:syst_model}

There are 67 systematics for the atmospheric sample, adopted from SK atmospheric studies~\cite{Abe:2017aap}.
These are listed in \refapp{cha:systematics} where they are grouped among flux, cross-section, and %
event separation systematics.
In this study, the atmospheric uncertainties are assumed to be uncorrelated between each other and uncorrelated with the beam systematics.
A more accurate systematic study for the atmospheric analysis of HK is expected in the future.
The main focus of this work is the beam sample and its systematic errors.

The T2K 2018 error model is employed~\cite{Abe:2018wpn} for the beam part.
There are 74 uncertainties for flux and cross-section parameters from near detector constraints, %
known as the BANFF fit, acronym for Beam And ND280 Flux extrapolation task Force.
%divided in $25\times 2$ systematics, for each beam mode, for the four main flux components, %
These are grouped in 50 systematics\,---\,25 for the $\nu$ mode and 25 for the $\cj{\nu}$~mode\,---\,%
for the main four flux components ($\nu_e$, $\nu_\mu$, $\cj{\nu}_e$, and $\cj{\nu}_\mu$), % 
and 24 systematics for cross-section parameters.
In the T2K experiment the neutrino flux and cross-section parameters are fitted from the unoscillated spectra of %
CC candidate events in ND280.
%Some of them are 2p-2h normalisation and shape for \tapi{16}O, CCQE axial-mass scaling factor, %
%CC and NC interaction normalisations, random phase approximation (RPA) coefficients, and binding energy on oxygen.
The uncertainty from hadron-production data is the dominant source of systematic error of the flux model.
It is found that some of the beamline conditions slightly change in time, and so %
the on-axis INGRID detector constantly monitors the stability of the flux.
%The flux covariance matrix was constructed by removing the near-far correlations for time-dependent systematics %
%for the period during which ND280 data was not used in this analysis. 
Even though the flux uncertainty is approximately 9\,\% at the peak energy, %
its impact on oscillation parameter uncertainties is significantly smaller,
given that the near and far detector measurements sample nearly the same flux.
%As mentioned earlier, the neutrino interactions are simulated with the NEUT [15] neutrino interaction generator.

The dominant CCQE interaction (see \refsec{sec:ccqe}) %
is modelled with a relativistic Fermi gas nuclear model including long-range correlations %
using the random phase approximation (RPA)~\cite{Nieves:2004wx}.
The 2p-2h model implemented is developed by Nieves and collaborators~\cite{Nieves:2011pp,Gran:2013kda}, %
which predicts multinucleon emission considering contributions from $\Delta$-like meson exchange currents %
and from interactions with correlated nucleon--nucleon pairs.
These different modes give rise to specific biases in the reconstructed neutrino energy %
when calculated with the quasi-elastic formula of \refsec{eq:e_reco}.
This effect is adjusted by introducing systematic parameters for the components of the model %
related to \tapi{12}C and \tapi{16}O and interactions, being these two the principal target nucleons in ND280.
There is an additional uncertainty on the relative normalisation between such parameters.
The $q^2$ dependence of the RPA correction is allowed to vary as well, parameterising it over four additional variables.
Processes producing a single pion and one or more nucleons in the final state are instead %
described by a tuned Rein-Sehgal model~\cite{Rein:1980wg}.
The differences between radiative corrections to electron- or muon-neutrino interactions are large at low energies~\cite{Day:2012gb}.
This is due to the different final-state lepton mass and the issue is addressed by adding uncorrelated and anticorrelated %
uncertainties to $\nu_e$ and $\cj{\nu}_e$ CC cross-sections in relation to the muon neutrino ones.
Other important parameters are the the axial-mass $m_A$, the Fermi momentum $p_F$, and the nucleon binding energy $E_b$, %
which are uncorrelated to the \tapi{12}C and \tapi{16}O systematics and are left unconstrained given the poor agreement %
from other neutrino experiments~\cite{Kabirnezhad:2017jmf}.

	\label{fig:correlation}
\end{figure}

There are also 45 uncertainties for SK detector efficiencies and Final State Interactions (FSI),
which parameterise the uncertainties on the four final state event selections at the far detector. %
Among these, one uncorrelated systematic describes the energy scale uncertainty.
%The energy scale calibration of the far detector is a crucial step to scale systematic of SK is assumed to be valid for HK.
The reconstruction of the momenta in a neutrino event is mainly based on the charge collected by the PMTs; %
for this reason, the resolution is mostly limited by water quality and PMT gain.
A precise momentum determination of the incoming neutrino is a necessary requirement for oscillation analysis.
The calibration of the energy scale is therefore a crucial step and in SK it is performed %
using four well-understood independent control samples~\cite{Abe:2017aap}.
%from 1\,GeV to 10\,GeV by high energy stopping muons; from 200\,MeV to 500\,MeV by low energy stopping muons;
%around 130\,MeV by neutral pions from neutrino interactions; %
%around 40\,MeV from decay electrons.
Since the energy loss $\dv*{E}{x}$ is approximately constant, %
the ratio between reconstructed momentum and track length of high energy stopping muon  %
is used to regulate the energy scale for energies in the range $1\sim10$\,GeV.
The track is estimated from the entering position of the muon and the vertex of the detected Michel electron, %
both of which are assumed to be independent on the reconstruction method.
The momentum of low-energy stopping muons with energies from 200\,MeV to 500\,MeV are estimated by determining the %
Cherenkov angle using \refeqs{eq:cherenkov_threshold}{eq:cherenkov_angle}; %
only events with a clear Cherenkov ring and optimal reconstruction are selected, %
and the purity of the sample is improved by requiring the detection of the decay electron in the fiducial volume.
The single neutral pions produced in NC interactions of atmospheric neutrinos are reconstructed %
by looking at the invariant mass of the final state photons
\begin{equation}
	m_{\pi^0}^2 = 2\,p_{\gamma_1}\,p_{\gamma_2} (1-\cos\theta)\ ,
\end{equation}
with $\theta$ being the opening angle between $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$.
The error on the energy scale at around 130\,MeV comes from comparing the peak positions %
of the data and Monte Carlo distributions of $m_{\pi^0}$.
Finally, the distribution of decay electron events from stopping cosmic muons is used at energies around 40\,MeV.
This sample is used to test whether the detector response is uniform, since %
vertices and the direction of the electrons distribute homogeneously and isotropically in the fiducial volume.
The stability in time of the energy scale is instead validated by the high energy stopping muons.
The energy scale systematic of SK is assumed to be valid for HK.

The full list of systematics is reported in \refapp{cha:systematics}.
The correlation matrix between the beam systematics is shown as a 2D colour map on \reffig{fig:correlation}, %
from which the three main typologies of uncertainties\,---\,flux, cross-section, and far detector\,---\,%
are easily recognised.
The SK and FSI systematics are visibly uncorrelated with the BANFF ones.
%and the far detector energy scale error.



\subsection{Sensitivity with the nominal systematic model}
\label{sec:nominal}

Using the predictions from \refsec{sec:prediction} and fixing the \emph{true} oscillation parameter %
combination at the Asimov A point (see \reftab{tab:asimovA}), %
the $\chi^2$ profile is now calculated with the minimisation method in previous \refsec{sec:x2}.
A combined fit of the $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu$ samples allows to estimate the sensitivity of HK %
to the oscillation parameters.
The $\chi^2$ profiles against the variation of the oscillation parameters %
$\Delta m^2_{32}$, $\sin^2 2\theta_{13}$, $\sin^2 \theta_{23}$, and $\delta_\text{CP}$ %
are shown in \reffig{fig:nominal_profile}.
The contour plots of the $\chi^2$ with $\Delta m_{32}^2$ versus $\sin^2\theta_{23}$ and %
$\delta_\text{CP}$ and $\sin^2 2\theta_{13}$ are also shown.
The lines show also the effect of the Gaussian penalty term on the angle $\theta_{13}$ from reactor constraints.
Unsurprisingly, this term mostly affects the $\chi^2$ profile for $\sin^2 2\theta_{13}$ and slightly $\delta_\text{CP}$ %
as they are correlated.

\end{figure}


The full sensitivity to exclude CP conservation computed with the nominal systematic model %
is shown in \reffig{fig:nominal_sensitivity}.
The effect of the Gaussian penalty term does not impact the sensitivity of HK to CP violation, %
hence this term is always included in the following results.
In \reffig{fig:nominal_sensitivity}, the sensitivity is shown at different stages of the experiment.
The effect is simulated by rescaling event samples.
With only a quarter of the data collected, a maximally violating CP phase could be found with a significance of $3\,\sigma$, %
but with half of the statistics $5\,\sigma$ are easily reached.
Increasing the collected samples, the sensitivity quickly saturates to the best exclusion of $\sim$6.5\,$\sigma$.

	\label{fig:combined_sens}
\end{figure}

The usefulness of performing a combined fit between beam and atmospheric %
data can be best understood from \reffig{fig:combined_sens}.
When the expected ($E_n$) and observed ($O_n$) event distributions are built for the $\chi^2$ calculation, %
a neutrino mass hierarchy must be assumed.
In reality, the true mass ordering is unknown and unless this freedom is parameterised in some way, %
it can happen that the wrong mass hierarchy is used in defining the expected events.
In this case, the sensitivity to certain values of $\delta_\text{CP}$ can deteriorate.
For example, if the true mass ordering is normal hierarchy and inverted hierarchy is assumed in the fit, %
the sensitivity for $\delta_\text{CP} < 0$ remains unaffected, whereas the one for $\delta_\text{CP} > 0$ worsens.
The opposite occurs in the reverse situation.
Adding the atmospheric sample to the likelihood calculation allows to partially recover the exclusion power to CP conservation.
The very long baseline of atmospheric neutrinos amplifies matter effects, thanks to which the sensitivity %
of the experiment to mass ordering is restored.
The differences between expected and observed events thus intensify, leading to larger values of the likelihood.

\end{figure}

Previous studies~\cite{Abe:2018wpn} found that some systematic uncertainties %
were not easily implemented by varying model parameters.
These were then the subjects of fake data studies, where a variant systematic model was analysed under %
the assumptions of the default model.
A series of modifications of the nominal systematic model are considered also in this study.
New systematic sets are created and by performing sensitivity studies with these variations of the nominal model %
it is possible to determine whether certain systematic errors need more control than other.
All of the produced sets are listed in \reftab{tab:variations}, even though only %
some of them have been analysed for this thesis and they are:
increment of the $\nu_e$ flux uncertainty in the $\nu$-mode beam by 2\% (labelled \textbf{8}); %
increment of the energy scale uncertainty, from 2.4\,\% to 2.9\,\% (labelled \textbf{11a}); %
decrement of the energy scale uncertainty, from 2.4\,\% to 1.9\,\% (labelled \textbf{11b}).
The choice of these sets is motivated by the fact that the number of systematic errors is the same %
with respect to the nominal model and the modified uncertainties are well understood by the various analysis groups.
The remaining variations will be analysed in future studies.
The new three profiles are shown collectively with the nominal model (labelled \textbf{0}) in \reffig{fig:0_11a_11b_8_profile}.
The $\chi^2$ as a function of $\delta_\text{CP}$ and $\sin^2 2\theta_{13}$ changes slightly with a different flux uncertainty, %
but it is not very much affected by a variation of the energy scale error.
The opposite is true for $\chi^2$ versus $\Delta m_{32}^2$ or $\sin^2\theta_{23}$, in which %
varying the energy scale error is reflected in larger deviations from the nominal model away from the best fit value.
The contour plots in \reffig{fig:0_11a_11b_8_profile} confirm that no appreciable deviation from the nominal model %
is seen for $\chi^2$ levels corresponding to $1\,\sigma$ and $3\,\sigma$.
In terms of sensitivity, the variation induced by the modified systematic model is %
less than 0.1\,\% at values of maximal violation of CP, as it can be appreciated in \reffig{fig:0_11a_11b_8_sensitivity}.
The treatment of the energy scale uncertainty with the methodology described in this chapter might be too simplistic.
The linear behaviour of the systematic errors (see \refeq{eq:linear}) should be applied with mindfulness: %
it follows that the systematic parameters in the $\chi^2$ could commute with each other.
The energy scale error, however, does not since it effectively shifts the bin contents of the event distributions.
It is also believed that this parameter is simultaneously constrained by the $e$-like samples %
the $\mu$-like samples, thus exhibiting no appreciable effect on the sensitivity prediction.
The calibration of the energy scale is, as a matter of fact, performed separately %
on stopping muon and decay electron events, as explained in \refsec{sec:syst_model}.
There is probably need to improve the systematic model by not only splitting the energy scale systematic %
between the two data samples, but also by changing the $\chi^2$ definition and the way this parameter is treated.

Keeping in mind the above caveats, the sensitivity to $\delta_\text{CP}$ from \reffig{fig:0_11a_11b_8_sensitivity} %
is above $6\,\sigma$ at full statistics.
It is expected that the systematics variations of \reftab{tab:variations} should not degrade %
the significance of CP conservation exclusion below this value.
Further studies are in place before the definitive quantitative results, %
since a more accurate treatment of the energy scale parameter is needed.
Once the beam sample is extensively analysed, the atmospheric sample can be added to the $\chi^2$ calculation %
and a more comprehensive systematic model can be adopted.
