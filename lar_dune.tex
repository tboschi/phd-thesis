\chapter{DUNE sensitivity to HNL}

Heavy nearly-sterile neutrinos are a common ingredient in extensions of the
Standard Model which aim to explain neutrino masses, like for instance in Type I
seesaw models, or one of its variants. If the scale of the new Heavy Neutral Leptons (HNLs) is sufficiently low, 
observable signatures can arise in a range of current and upcoming experiments, from the LHC to neutrino experiments.
%
In this article, we discuss the phenomenology of sterile neutrinos in the MeV to GeV mass range, focusing on their decays. We embed our discussion in a realistic mass model and consider the resulting implications.
%
We focus in particular on the impact on the signal of the strong polarisation
effects in the beam for Majorana and \mbox{(pseudo-)Dirac} states, providing formulae 
to incorporate these in both production and decay.
%
We study how the Near Detector of the upcoming Deep Underground Neutrino
Experiment can constrain HNL states by searching for their decay products inside the detector.
%
We conduct a Monte Carlo background analysis for the most promising
signatures, incorporating the detector's particle identification capabilities,
and estimate the experimental sensitivity of DUNE to these particles.  
%
We also present an estimate of the \mbox{$\nu_\tau$-derived} HNL flux at DUNE, 
currently missing in the literature, which allows us to discuss searches for 
HNLs at higher masses.

\section{The DUNE experiment}

\section{Simulation of events at DUNE ND}
\label{sec:experiment}

DUNE~\cite{Abi:2018dnh} is a long-baseline oscillation experiment that will study neutrino physics in great detail, %
focusing mainly on the determination of the CP violating phase, $\delta_\text{CP}$, %
of the mass ordering, %
%i.e.\ the sign of $\Delta m_{31}^2$,
and on the precision measurement of other oscillation parameters, in particular $\theta_{23}$.
These goals can be achieved thanks to both an intense neutrino beam and a high-resolution Far Detector (FD), %
consisting of a 40\,kt Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC), situated \np{1300}\,km from the beam target.
The drift velocity of ionised electrons in LAr, typically of the order of cm/\textmu s, %
can be controlled with sufficient precision, by tuning the electric field, %
to result in high spatial resolution for event reconstruction~\cite{Rubbia:1977zz}.
%The c
%with liquefied argon instead of its gaseous phase.
%The LAr is advantageous compared to the gaseous counterpart because it is around one thousand times denser, %
%increasing the interaction probability, which is valuable for neutrino physics.
%Employing very pure argon, the recombination of released electrons can be reduced and %
%so the LArTPC design can be scaled to large volumes, as it will be done for DUNE.
%LAr also scintillates with a high light yield, around 40 photons/keV, but, differently from other liquefied noble gasses, %
%LAr is transparent to its scintillation wavelength, which peaks at \np{126.8}~nm.
%A photo-detection system can collect the scintillation light giving an additional handle on event reconstruction.
%All these exceptional properties make LArTPC a powerful tool for precision neutrino physics.
A very sensitive FD alone, however, is not enough due to numerous uncertainties on neutrino flux and cross sections.
A smaller and closer detector, called Near Detector (ND), is therefore adopted to normalise the flux of neutrinos reaching the FD and to help cancel out many of %
the neutrino-nucleon cross section systematics.

The DUNE ND will be placed \np{574}\,m from the target.
Its final design has not been finalised yet, but it will likely be a hybrid concept, %
consisting of a small LArTPC placed in front of a magnetised high-pressure gaseous TPC.
This module is complementary to the front detector, controlling escaping or below-threshold particles from the LArTPC, %
but is also capable of performing standalone measurement.
For its versatile nature, it is called Multi-Purpose Detector (MPD).
The sub-system LArTPC/MPD will be movable inside the ND hall---following the DUNE-PRISM concept---for better profiling the neutrino flux %
at different angles.
There will be a third module, a 3D Scintillation Tracker (3DST), on-axis, to monitor %
the stability of the beam flux and neutron contamination.
Currently, the proposed fiducial volume for the LArTPC module is 24\,m\tapi{3} (around 35\,t of LAr), employing the ArgonCube technology~\cite{Amsler:1993255}, %
whereas the design for the MPD is based on the TPC in \mbox{ALICE}~\cite{Glassel:2004jv}, %
a cylinder of 100\,m\tapi{3} with gas at a pressure of 10\,atm and a fiducial mass of~1\,t.
The~3DST is designed to have a fiducial mass of around \np{8.7}\,t of plastic scintillating material and %
wavelength shifting plates.
%($3\times2\times6$)\,m\tapi{3},
%and for the HPArFGT is ($3.5\times3.5\times6.4$)\,m\tapi{3}.
For this analysis, we take only in account the two core sub-detectors, the LArTPC and the MPD.
The main difference between these two ND modules is that the gaseous TPC has a larger volume than the LArTPC.
This feature is favourable for studying rare events, like heavy neutrino decays, because more neutrinos enter the fiducial volume.
Furthermore, the lower density of the MPD helps reduce the number of neutrino scattering events, which are background to rare signatures.
Apart from volume and density differences and relative positions in the detector hall, %
we treat the two ND units as with similar detection performances, on-axis, and do not take in account the magnetisation of the gaseous~TPC. 
%Optical partitioning, short electron drift distance, and pixelated readout are features being taken in consideration to %
%improve the performance of the LArTPC to the anticipated high-rate environment %
%and the efficiency of reconstructing events at the near site.

Thanks to its proximity to the accelerator, the ND will be exposed to an extremely intense neutrino beam, %
with a flux peak around five million times greater than at the FD.
The Long Baseline Neutrino Facility (LBNF) at Fermilab will deploy a very energetic beam of protons, %
extracted from the Main Injector (MI) and delivered to a graphite target.
The collision produces secondary particles, which are collimated by a focusing horn system and then decay forming a neutrino beam.
Assuming an 80\,GeV proton beam at 1.2\,MW for the first six years and at 2.4\,MW for a second set of six years~\cite{Abi:2018dnh}, 
the ND will collect in both neutrino and antineutrino mode a total of \np{2.65e22}\,POT %
over the runtime of the experiment.
In this work we consider only the beam in the neutrino mode configuration, %
which corresponds to half of the total runtime, or \np{1.32e22}\,POT.
The same study of this article can be applied equally to the beam in reversed horn current configuration, %
but its details are not available to us.
Including the analysis for the beam in antineutrino mode should result in an increment on the overall sensitivity, %
approximately a factor of two better.

%Moreover, the ND system could implement the $\nu$PRISM concept~\cite{Bhadra:2014oma}, which would make the detector %
%	movable, to take advantage of the monochromatic nature of the neutrino beam off-axis.

	\label{tab:nd}
\end{table}

A summary of the features of the ND system is reported in~\reftab{tab:nd}, where it is compared to other beam dump experiments: %
PS191~\cite{Bernardi:1985ny,Bernardi:1987ek}, SBND which is the detector of the SBN programme with the best sensitivity to %
HNL~\cite{Ballett:2016opr}, NA62~\cite{NA62:2017rwk}, and SHiP~\cite{Anelli:2015pba}.
We define the total exposure of the experiment as the proton accelerator beam power, integrated over the total run time, %
and scaled by the volume of the detector over its baseline squared.
The beam power times the run time corresponds to the number of protons on target (POT) times the proton energy. 
With this definition, an exposure twelve times bigger is expected for the DUNE ND system with respect to SBND, %
and around two hundred times bigger than PS191.
The NA62 and SHiP experiments have a different design and are not directly comparable to TPC and tracker experiments, %
but we report them here for thoroughness.
The estimated exposure of NA62 is limited by its number of POT and by just one year of data taking; %
despite this fact, the experiment is optimised to study kaon decays and has good %
sensitivity to HNL~\cite{Drewes:2018irr}.
The SHiP experiment presents an exposure thirty times bigger than DUNE ND, but the detector is specifically %
designed to search for BSM physics, including heavy neutrinos~\cite{SHiP:2018xqw} (see also~\refref{Caputo:2016ojx}).
The decay-in-flight search hugely benefits from its 50\,m long decay vessel and short baseline.

On the collider physics frontier, the FASER experiment~\cite{Ariga:2018uku} will perform a dedicated search for %
extremely weakly-interacting particles, like HNLs for which it presents interesting sensitivity~\cite{Kling:2018wct}.
The detector consists of a 10\,m cylindrical decay volume located 480\,m downstream of the ATLAS interaction point.

		The $\nu_\mu$ component (top right) obtains its main contribution from $\pi^+$ decays at low energies, %

	\label{fig:fluxes}
\end{figure}

%A powerful proton beam is responsible for the very intense neutrino flux at the LBNF facility.
In order to implement our analysis, the various components of the flux by parentage must be known separately.
We study only the beam operating with a forward horn current, which selects %
positively charged secondary particles and results in a beam dominantly made of neutrinos %
with a smaller component of antineutrinos.
%
The flux predictions for $\nu_e$, $\nu_\mu$, and $\cj{\nu}_\mu$, provided by \refref{LauraFields} for the reference beam, %
are shown in~\reffig{fig:fluxes} subdivided in their parent components.
The $\nu_\mu$ flux is the dominant component and is principally originated %
by pion decays, whilst its long tail comes from kaon decays.
Unsuccessfully deflected negative particles, like $\pi^-$ or $K^-$, and the $\mu^+$ are the main contributors %
to the $\cj{\nu}_\mu$ components, and $\nu_e$ comes predominately from the muon %
and both $K^+$ and $K^0$ decays.
We consider only the energy range $E < 20\,\text{GeV}$, because it is the most intense region of the flux %
and, as it will be explained in~\refsec{sec:numevt}, the most relevant for this study.

	\label{fig:taudist}
\end{figure}

We highlight here the fact that we expect also an albeit-small flux of HNLs with masses above the kaon one.
This could be inferred from the $\nu_\tau$ flux, but this is not available in the literature.
In fact, the lightest meson with an interesting decay width to tau neutrinos is the charmed-strange meson~$D_s^+$, %
which has a mass $m_{D_s} = \np{1968.34}\pm\np{0.07}$\,MeV~\cite{PDG}.
It~decays into $\tau^+ \nu_\tau$ with a branching ratio of $\np{5.48}\pm\np{0.23}$\,\%.
HNL with masses above the $K^0$ can be produced via the tau mixing, but more importantly via %
the muonic and electronic ones which are enhanced, as shown in \refsec{sec:production}.
The meson $D^+$ also decays into $\tau^+ \nu_\tau$, but being lighter than the $D_s^+$, %
the decay is disfavoured by the smaller phase space, with a branching ratio~50 times smaller.
This meson presents three-body decay channels into $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu$ with much higher branching ratio, %
but there is no enhancement for such channels into HNL, as explained in \refsec{sec:production}, and so these subdominant components %
are not taken in account in the present study.

%However, HNL with masses above the $K^0$ mass can only be produced by the decays of $D^+$ and $D_s^+$, %
%and the production of massive neutrinos could be enhanced, especially if produced via the $|U_{e 4}|^2$ mixing.
%{\color{red} What about the decay of $D^+$?? The considerations of it being disfavoured because of phase space would not apply to decay into N and muons or N and electron, which are enhanced compared to the standard case.}
%We make an estimate of the $\nu_\tau$ spectrum, starting from the $D_s^+$ production by %
%an 80\,GeV proton beam hitting a fixed graphite target.
The proton beam has a relatively low energy for producing charm quarks with a high cross-section, %
so the prediction of $\nu_\tau$ has not been carried out by the collaboration to the best of our knowledge.
For the reasons stated above, we make a prediction for the $D_s^+$ production by %
an 80\,GeV proton beam hitting a fixed graphite target.
The distribution at the production site will be then used to estimate the $\nu_\tau$ flux at the ND system.
In the literature, the following parametrisation has been successfully used to describe %
the charm meson production in proton-proton collision in the Centre of Mass frame~\cite{Ammar:1988ta}
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:dsflux}
	\frac{\dd[2]{\sigma}}{\dd{x_F}\dd{p_T^2}} \sim (1-|x_F|)^n e^{-b p_T^2}~,
\end{equation}
where $x_F = 2 p_z/\sqrt{s}$, with $p_z$ the longitudinal momentum in the CM frame. %
The parameters $n$ and $b$ were fitted from the E769 experiment and found to be %
$n = \np{6.1}\pm\np{0.7}$ and \mbox{$b = \np{1.08}\pm\np{0.09}$}~\cite{Alves:1996qz}.
We assume that the $D_s^+$ meson production at the target follows the same distribution.
With the help of a Monte Carlo simulation, we generate the $D_s^+$ four-momenta starting from~\refeq{eq:dsflux} %
and simulate the meson decay and the subsequent tau decays.
A key simplification here is that because of the short lifetime of the $D_s^+$ and $\tau^+$, %
of the order of \np{e-13}\,s, their path is not affected by the horn system nor by interactions with other accelerator components. 
This results in no focusing of these secondary particles, and so only neutrinos emitted %
within the geometric acceptance of the ND are considered to form the $\nu_\tau$ and $\cj{\nu}_\tau$ spectrum.
The overall normalisation comes from an open charm calculation (see~\refapp{sec:opencc} for details): %
the number of $D_s^+$ per POT is found to be $(2.8 \pm 0.2) \times \np{e-6}$.
The result of the simulation is reported in the bottom right panel of~\reffig{fig:fluxes}, %
where the different contributions to the $\nu_\tau$ spectrum are shown.
Thanks to the large number of POTs in DUNE, the total number of $D_s^+$ mesons produced is comparable %
to other dedicated experiments~\cite{Alekhin:2015byh}; %
however, the beamline design is not optimised for heavy mesons production %
and the $\nu_\tau$ flux seen at the ND is strongly attenuated.%: %
%according to our simulation, only \np{0.13}\,\% of the neutrinos produced at the target reaches the ND.

Having knowledge of the parent meson distribution, we directly simulate the production of nearly-sterile neutrinos %
from the $D_s$ decays.
The spectrum of heavy neutrinos is distorted when their mass approaches the various phase space thresholds, %
which appears as a further enhancement of the flux. 
This is because heavier neutrinos are more easily boosted inside the geometric acceptance of the detector.
Besides the peak height, the start and the end point of the energy flux are also affected,
as illustrated in~\reffig{fig:taudist}. 
We take these effects in account, modifying the scaled neutrino flux using information retrieved by the $\nu_\tau$ and $\cj{\nu}_\tau$~simulation. 

\subsection{Background evaluation}
\label{sec:background}

%The major source of noise comes from ordinary neutrino-nucleon interactions happening within the fiducial volume of the detector.
%As shown in~\reftab{tab:rate}, the ND will expect a copious number of CC and NC events. %, usually categorised as: %
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Charged Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) interactions whether a charged lepton is present in the final state, %
%		revealing the flavour state of the incoming neutrino;
%	\item Neutral Current Elastic (NCE) scatterings if there is no charged lepton;
%	\item CC resonant pion production (CC1$\pi$) when a pion is also emitted;
%	\item NC resonant pion production (NC1$\pi$) if it is mediated by neutral currents;
%	\item Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) which classifies all interaction happening at high energy and with high level %
%	of hadronization.
%\end{itemize}

The number of SM neutrino--nucleon interactions expected at the DUNE ND, without considering detector effects, is calculated %
by integrating the Charged Current (CC) and Neutral Current (NC) total cross sections multiplied %
by the light neutrino spectrum~$\dv*{\phi_\nu}{E}$:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:numev}
	\mathcal{N}_\text{tot} = \mathcal{N}_\text{CC} + \mathcal{N}_\text{NC} = 
	\mathcal{N}_\text{target} \int \dd{E} \qty[\sigma_\text{CC}(E) + \sigma_\text{NC}(E)] \, \dv{\phi_\nu}{E}\ ,
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_\text{CC}(E)$ and $\sigma_\text{NC}(E)$ are the cross section predictions in argon %
calculated with \mbox{\textsc{genie}}~\cite{Andreopoulos:2009rq}, and $\mathcal{N}_\text{target}$ is the %
total number of Ar targets. 
The event rates are shown in~\reftab{tab:rate}.
It turns out that less than one $\nu_\tau$ event is expected in the total run of the experiment.
As~a~comparison, the number of $\nu_\mu$ events will be \np{e10} times higher.
This confirms the expectations that the $\nu_\tau$ component of the flux is negligible %
for standard oscillation physics in~DUNE ND.
On the other hand $\nu_\tau$ appearance is expected at the FD.


%%%% START EDIT

These neutrino scatterings occurring within the fiducial volume of the detector could mimic %
the rare signal of neutrino in-flight decays, as some final state particles are common to both processes.
A good estimate of the number of possible background events for each discovery channel is very important, %
since it dictates the true sensitivity of the experiment.
We restrict our conservative background analysis to decay modes available for neutrino masses below $m_{K^0}$, %
being these the channels with the best discovery potential.
They are $N\to\nu e^+ e^-$, $\nu e^\pm \mu^\mp$, $\nu \mu^+ \mu^-$, $\nu \pi^0$, $e^\mp \pi^\pm$, and $\mu^\mp \pi^\pm$.
%
Particles are typically tagged by studying the topology of the tracks and the energy loss $\dv*{E}{x}$ in the active medium, %
but instead of dealing with a full detector simulation, we perform a fast Monte Carlo analysis, %
using as input neutrino--nucleon scattering events in argon generated by the neutrino event generator \textsc{genie}~\cite{Andreopoulos:2009rq}.
The tracks are randomly placed inside the ND system and then smeared according to a normal distribution centred on the simulated value of energy/momentum; %
particles with a kinetic energy above the detection threshold are then assumed to be reconstructed.
%
The relative position between the two detectors is taken into account, in that %
particle tracks exiting the LArTPC end entering the FGT are reconstructed as a single track.
Escaping or partially reconstructed tracks are not discarded, but treated with a different energy/momentum resolution: %
the initial particle energy can be estimated, with some limitations, thanks to the energy dependence of the mean energy loss %
during the particle propagation.
We then implement possible sources of background mis-identification which are channel specific.
Detector resolutions and thresholds, from~\refref{Alion:2016uaj} for both parts of the ND, are summarised in~\reftab{tab:fastmc}.

%
A strong discriminant for background events is the presence of protons, neutrons, and other hadrons in the final states, %
which are the results of the nucleus recoil of the neutrino interaction.
%If the nucleon or nucleus recoil in a neutrino-nucleon interaction can be identified, %
If hadronic activity is reconstructed as an interaction vertex, then the event is clearly originated by %
SM neutrino--nucleon scattering and tagged as background.
In the case this does not happen, for instance when the hadrons are below threshold, the multiplicity of final state particles %
becomes fundamental to distinguish signal events from intrinsic background.
However, this background can be worsened by mis-identification of certain tracks.

The main background to the pseudo-scalar meson channels, $N\to \ell^\mp \pi^\pm$, are resonance $\nu_e$ or $\nu_\mu$--CC %
interaction with single pion production or incoherent and deep inelastic scatterings in which only a pair $\ell\,\pi$ is detected.
Three-body lepton decays suffers from mis-identification of additional pions and photons emitted in CC neutrino scatterings %
which are mistaken for charged leptons.
Despite having a similar mass, pion and muon tracks differ on average in length, as the meson track often culminates in a hadronic shower.
In~our implementation of the detector effects, if no hadronic shower is detected and the track length is longer than two metres, %
the pion is identified as a muon.
Electromagnetic shower induced by photons are identified by looking at the vertex displacement and at the $\dv*{E}{x}$, %
which is twice as large as the energy loss for $e^\pm$.
If a photon converts within two centimetres from the interaction point, and either the electron or the positron of the pair is below threshold, %
the photon is reconstructed as a single electron.
%assuming the other electron of the pair doesn't shower or is below threshold.
A pair of electrons with a small separation angle, less than 3\textdegree, is tagged as an electron-positron pair %
and the parent photon is reconstructed.
The main source of photons comes from the decay of the neutral pion, which is abundantly produced in neutrino--nucleon interactions.
Certain hadronic transitions from secondary particles of deep inelastic scatterings also emit gammas.
If a pair of photons shows an invariant mass comparable with the $\pi^0$ mass, the parent pion is identified.
Interactions in which multiple neutral pions are produced, but only a pair of photons is detected and reconstructed, %
can be background to the $N\to \nu \pi^0$ channel.
The~background events surviving particle identification are between 5\,\% down to 0.01\,\% of the processed events, %
the rejection of which strongly depends on the analysed channel.

%A million neutrino-nucleon events in argon is generated using the neutrino event generator \textsc{genie}~\cite{Andreopoulos:2009rq} %
%and then smeared according to a normal distribution centred on the simulated value of energy/momentum: %

%We use the same resolutions and thresholds from~\refref{Alion:2016uaj} for both parts of the ND.
%These are summarised in~\reftab{tab:fastmc}.
%We then implement detector geometry effects and possible sources of misidentification.

%and up to a factor of $\sim\np{e4}$.

The channels which open up for masses above the kaon mass are more challenging from an experimental point of view.
The final state particles of these modes are mostly neutral pseudo-scalar mesons, which decay electromagnetically, %
or vector mesons, which usually decay into a multi-state of lighter mesons, depending on the initial flavour content,
sometimes accompanied by photon emission.
The correct identification of these short-lived states is non trivial.
For very high masses, also $\tau$ leptons are yielded, but their precise reconstruction requires \emph{ad hoc} techniques.
These tasks are beyond the scope of the analysis presented here and are best left to the collaboration superior simulation tools.
We also do not consider cosmogenic background, even though a rate of \np{2.7}\,Hz/m\tapi{2} cosmic rays %
is expected at the ND hall~\cite{Sinclair:DUNEdoc}, which has very little over burden.
Given an area of a few square meters, the number of cosmic rays per drift window can be non-negligible~\cite{Abi:2018dnh}, %
but rejection techniques are being developed with good signal efficiencies~\cite{Adams:2018lzd}.

\subsection{HNL decay events and signal efficiency}
\label{sec:numevt}

Except for $N$ decaying into three neutrinos, all the other decay channels are in principle detectable.
%Some decay modes contribute more significantly to the physics reach thanks to larger branching ratios and lower backgrounds.
%Along with the number of background events, a correct estimation of the number of decays in the visible channels %
%is necessary in order to evaluate the sensitivity of DUNE ND to the discovery of HNL.
%It is therefore fundamental to estimate the number of possible background events $\mathcal{B}_d$ for each channel $d$, %
For a given visible decay mode~$d$, the number of signal events is
%The expected number of heavy neutrino decays inside the detector for a given decay channel~$d$ %
%can be estimated with the following formula:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:event}
	\mathcal{N}_d = \int\!\! \dd{E}\ \Pi_d(E) W_d(E)\, \dv{\phi_N}{E}\ ,
\end{equation}
where $\dv*{\phi_N}{E}$ is the number of heavy neutrinos expected at the ND, %
computed in the way described in~\refsec{sec:production}.
The function $\Pi_d(E)$ accounts for the probability of a heavy neutrino of energy $E$ to decay inside the ND after covering the baseline distance $L$.
It is expressed in the following form:
\begin{equation}
	\Pi_d(E) = e^{-\frac{\Gamma_\text{tot} L}{\gamma \beta}} %
	\qty(1-e^{-\frac{\Gamma_\text{tot} \lambda}{\gamma \beta}}) \frac{\Gamma_d}{\Gamma_\text{tot}}\ , 
\end{equation}
where $\lambda$ is the length of the ND, $\Gamma_d$ the decay rate for the channel $d$ and %
$\Gamma_\text{tot}$ the total decay rate.
The total effect of $\Pi_d$ is to favour low-energy bins of the neutrino spectrum for which the %
relativistic factor $\gamma\beta$ is small.

The term $W_d(E)$ is a signal efficiency factor, estimated as the binned ratio of the true $N$ energy spectrum after %
and before a background rejection procedure.
The latter is a process aiming to further reduce the number of background events still present after particle identification.
It consists of simple data selection cuts optimised to reject the background while minimising the loss of signal events, %
exploiting differences in the energy and angular distributions of signal and background events.
The HNL decays inside the detector are simulated by a custom Monte Carlo code and the tracks are processed in the same way %
as it is done for background events (see~\refsec{sec:background}).
The resulting signal efficiency therefore embeds also detector effects.
If no background is expected for the channel $d$, there is no need for applying any rejection procedure %
and so the signal efficiency is maximal, i.e.\ $W_d(E) = 1$ at all energies.
The final number of background events $\mathcal{B}_d$ and the number of signal events $\mathcal{N}_d$ are %
eventually used to build the Confidence Level (C.L.) regions of sensitivity (see \refsec{sec:results}).
%
%The term $W_d(E)$ is a weighting factor given by the binned ratio of the true $N$ energy spectrum after %
%and before the background reduction procedure.
%{\color{red} We discuss the backgrounds in the previous section. Why this stuff is here?} The latter process aims to further reduce the number of background events, still present after particle identification.
%It consists of simple data selection cuts optimised to reject the background while maintaining a high signal efficiency, %
%exploiting differences in the distributions of signal and background events.
%In general terms, background events are expected to have a more isotropic angular distribution %
%compared to decay-in-flight which are very boosted forward.	
%Signal events are generated with a custom Monte Carlo code and are processed in the same manner as the background events (see~\refsec{sec:background}).
%{\color{red} THE FOLLOWING IS NOT CLEAR In this way, the final weighting factor is the result of not only data selection cuts, but also detector effects.
%	If no background is expected before the event rejection process, then these factors are maximal, i.e.\ $W_d(E) = 1$ %
%	at all energies.
%	IS THAT SO?????? THE FOLLOWING IS NOT CLEAR EITHER. The final number of background events $\mathcal{B}_d$ is eventually used to define the Confidence Level (C.L.) regions of sensitivity.}
We leave a more detailed discussion on the background reduction cuts in~\refapp{sec:appbackground}, %
where we report the rates of background reduction and signal selection for all decay channels of both Majorana and Dirac neutrinos of a given mass.
We note that the Dirac neutrino decays generally have a lower signal efficiency, between 5\% and 10\% less, %
compared to a Majorana state of the same mass.
%All decay rates not listed above are forbidden for a Dirac (anti-)particle as the combination of production and decay would amount to a LNV process.
This is a consequence of certain combinations of production and decay modes which are forbidden for Dirac neutrinos, %
as they would lead to LNV.
The final true energy distributions of Majorana and Dirac neutrinos can therefore be different.
When looking at the NC decay $N\to\nu \pi^0$, the difference in signal efficiency is almost recovered, %
thanks to the angular dependence of Dirac neutrino decays which makes it more distinguishable from background.

%This is a consequence of the different angular distribution between Majorana and Dirac neutrino decays.
%Because we are not taking in account charge identification in our analysis, Majorana neutrino decays are isotropic in the CM.
%{\color{red} THIS IS NOT CLEAR. In the case of Dirac neutrinos, there is a forward-backward asymmetry resulting from the unbalanced components of neutrinos and antineutrinos in the beam.
%	The difference in the angular distributions is slightly reflected in the laboratory frame and hence the signal efficiency can be affected.}

%	This can be seen as the limit in which the size of the detector $\lambda$ is %
%	greater than the decay length of the Majorana neutrino, $\beta \gamma\ \Gamma_\text{tot}^{\np{-1}}$, %
%	and the probability is approximated by
%	\begin{equation}
%		\Pi_d(E) \simeq e^{-\frac{\Gamma_\text{tot} L}{\gamma \beta}} \frac{\Gamma_d}{\Gamma_\text{tot}}\ .
%	\end{equation}
%	In this regime the event rate does not dependent on the detector size, as heavy neutrinos decay within a few %
%	decay lengths.

%The number of signal events is then compared to the expected number of background events.
%For a specific channel $d$, the probability of observing $n$ events with a signal mean $\sigma = \mathcal{N}_d$ %
%and background $b = \mathcal{B}_d$ follows a Poisson distribution:
%\begin{equation*}
%	P(n|\sigma,b) = (\sigma+b) \frac{e^{-(\sigma+b)}}{n!}\ .
%\end{equation*}
%The null hypothesis $H_0$ is that no sterile neutrino decays are seen ($\sigma = 0$), %
%while only background events $b$ are expected.
%We employ the Feldman and Cousins method~\cite{Feldman:1997qc} to estimate the number of events needed in order %
%to reject $H_0$ with the desired confidence level.
%For example, if no background is expected ($W_d = 1$), an average of $n = 2.44$ events %
%must be detected to reject $H_0$ with 90\,\% C.L.
%This criterion is used to define the sensitivity regions shown in~\refsec{sec:results} and~\ref{sec:combined}.



\section{Sensitivities of DUNE ND}
\label{sec:results}

We present here sensitivity regions for the discovery of heavy neutrino decays for %
a total amount of \np{1.32e22}\,POT collected with the beam in neutrino mode.
All the regions are estimated at the 90\,\% C.L.\ in rejecting the null hypothesis, %
by which no HNL decays are seen ($\sigma = 0$), but only background events $b$ are expected.
For a specific channel~$d$, the probability of observing $n$ events with a signal mean $\sigma = \mathcal{N}_d$ %
and background $b = \mathcal{B}_d$ (see~\refsec{sec:numevt}) follows a Poisson distribution
\begin{equation*}
	P(n|\sigma,b) = (\sigma+b) \frac{e^{-(\sigma+b)}}{n!}\ .
\end{equation*}
We employ the Feldman and Cousins method~\cite{Feldman:1997qc} to estimate the number of events needed in order %
to reject $H_0$ at the desired C.L..
For example, if no background is expected \mbox{($W_d = 1$)}, an average of $n = 2.44$ events %
must be detected to reject $H_0$ with 90\,\% C.L.\ 
This~criterion is used to define the sensitivity regions shown in this section, for both Majorana and Dirac neutrinos.
It is found in every case that the MPD alone has a better sensitivity than the LArTPC, %
thanks not only to a larger volume, but also to a less dense medium which gives lower backgrounds.
As the two modules are assumed to have the same detection performance, we present here a combined analysis of the %
two detectors, taking into account particle propagation between them.	
We do not consider charged identification capabilities of the ND, and therefore this information is washed out %
in presenting the sensitivity plots in this and next sections.
Because of our charge-blind analysis, the number of events expected for Majorana neutrinos is twice as large as %
the number in the case of Dirac neutrinos, therefore the sensitivity to Dirac neutrino decays is %
a factor of two worse than the Majorana case.
The limits reported here below refer to Majorana heavy neutrinos; the corresponding limit for which $N$ is a Dirac fermion %
is easily retrieved by doubling the upper limit.

In~\refsec{sec:dominant}, we show the constraint that DUNE ND can place on a simplified scenario %
in which a single mixing matrix element between HNL and active neutrinos dominates.
We~have also considered a scenario in which two mixings are dominant with respect to the third one, %
the results of which are presented in~\refsec{sec:bimax}.
%Finally, we make a comparison of this analysis with previous and recent results of beam dump experiment.
%and explain the how the experiment %
%can explore the parameter spaces of different neutrino mass models in the next section, \ref{sec:combined}.

	\label{fig:senseW}
\end{figure}

In this section, we present the sensitivity regions for the three mixings $|U_{e N}|^2$, $|U_{\mu N}|^2$, and %
$|U_{\tau N}|^2$, where we assume that just one mixing element dominates over the other two.
The~sensitivities for the decay channels $N\to\nu e^+ e^-$, $\nu e^\pm \mu^\mp$, $\nu \mu^+ \mu^-$, $\nu \pi^0$, % 
$e^\mp \pi^\pm$ ($|U_{e N}|^2$ only), and $\mu^\mp \pi^\pm$ ($|U_{\mu N}|^2$ only) are reported in \reffig{fig:senseW}.
The solid lines corresponds to a scenario in which zero background is assumed at the ND.
%The introduction of background worsens the sensitives, the lines of which are represented by dashed lines.
A background study is done for these channels (see~\refsec{sec:background}), to outline a more realistic sensitivity; %
the resulting regions are shown as dashed lines in \reffig{fig:senseW}.
As we expect that further improvements to background reduction can be achieved with a dedicated analysis by the experimental collaboration,
the final sensitivity will lie somewhere between the lines with and without backgrounds.

For both the electronic and the muonic mixings, the two-body semi-leptonic decay modes are the ones providing %
the best sensitivity for sufficiently heavy masses.
With the channel $N\to e^\mp \pi^\pm$, the mixing can be constrained in the range $0.15\,\text{GeV} \lesssim m_N \lesssim 0.49\,\text{GeV}$ %
to be $|U_{e N}|^2 < \np{3e-9}$, with a minimum point $|U_{e N}|^2 < \np{7e-11}$ at $m_N \simeq 0.39$\,GeV.
Including the background rejection, the limits are loosened by a factor of $\sim$3.5.
The~channel $N\to \mu^\mp \pi^\pm$ can constrain the mixing $|U_{\mu N}|^2 < \np{5.6e-10}$ %
in the mass range \mbox{$0.25\,\text{GeV} \lesssim m_N \lesssim 0.39\,\text{GeV}$}, with the best limit $|U_{\mu N}|^2 < \np{1.3e-10}$ %
at $m_N \simeq 0.35$\,GeV.
In this case, the higher background and the worse signal efficiency reduce the bound up to a factor of $\sim$5.6.
The NC decay $N\to \nu \pi^0$ is the channel most affected by background and with the worst signal efficiency: %
the limits are higher by a factor of~$\sim$9.0 for the electronic, $\sim$8.2 for the muonic, and~$\sim$11.7 for the tau mixing.
Assuming no background, instead, the constrains placed by this decay mode can be competitive, as the %
mixings are limited at best for $m_N \simeq 0.35$\,GeV to be $|U_{e N}|^2 < \np{1.1e-10}$ and %
$|U_{\mu N}|^2 < \np{1.6e-10}$, and $|U_{\tau N}|^2 < \np{5e-7}$ between $0.9\,\text{GeV} \lesssim m_N \lesssim 1.3\,\text{GeV}$.
%This difference is due to the fact that charge-ID is not taken in account in our analysis.
There is no sensitivity to the channel $N\to\tau^\mp\pi^\pm$ because of the subdominant branching ratio %
and flux content.

The three-body lepton decays have a lower reach, but are more sensitive to masses above the kaon mass limit %
than the two-body semi-leptonic modes.
The channel $N\to \nu e^- e^+$ is the only one that covers the whole mass range of interest and is the least affected by background reduction, %
with a factor less than 3.
It can limit the electronic mixing down to $|U_{e N}|^2 < \np{2.6e-9}$ at $m_N \simeq 0.11$\,GeV, %
$|U_{e N}|^2 < \np{3.0e-10}$ at $m_N \simeq 0.39$\,GeV, and $|U_{e N}|^2 < \np{3.0e-9}$ at $m_N \simeq 1.6$\,GeV.
The channels $N \to\nu \mu^- \mu^+$ and $\nu e^\pm \mu^\mp$, perform better with the muon mixing, %
despite suffering more from background rejection, between a factor of 8 for the muon mixing and up to a factor of 15 %
for the tau mixing.
They respectively give the limits %
$|U_{\mu N}|^2 < \np{9.2e-10}$ at $m_N \simeq 0.37$\,GeV and $|U_{\mu N}|^2 < \np{8.7e-8}$ at $m_N \simeq 1.5$\,GeV, and %
$|U_{\mu N}|^2 < \np{4.8e-10}$ at $m_N \simeq 0.36$\,GeV and $|U_{\mu N}|^2 < \np{6.4e-8}$ at $m_N \simeq 1.6$\,GeV.
The $\tau$ sector can only be constrained by the two NC--mediated channels, which give very similar constraints near $m_N\simeq 1$\,GeV, %
these being both $|U_{\tau N}|^2 < \np{1.2e-6}$.

%These regions are naturally weakened when the background analysis is taken in account.
%Instead of performing an event simulation for each value of the heavy neutrino mass, %
%we study the background expectancy only for 9 equally-spaced choices of heavy neutrino mass from 50 MeV to 450 MeV and we interpolate in between.
%%
%	%The weighting factors $W_d$ explained in section~\ref{sec:numevt} are extrapolated in the same manner.
%The channels less afflicted from background reduction analysis are the decays $N\to \ell_\alpha^- \pi^+$, %
%$N\to \nu e^-e^+$, and $N\to \nu e^\mp\mu^\pm$, the sensitivities of which are reduced by less than a factor of 10.
%The other channels present more background and the reduction in the sensitivity is slightly more than one order of magnitude.
%No background analysis is made for masses above the kaon mass.

A background study was not performed for all the other decay channels, which open up for masses above the $K^0$ mass, %
due to the fact that the final state particles need a more complex analysis.
The sensitivities to these modes are shown in~\reffig{fig:senseV}, and they can place some constraints to the mixing.
All the channels peak in their sensitivity for masses between $1.3$ and $1.8$\,GeV.
The best limits obtained for CC decays are %
$|U_{e N}|^2 < \np{2.3e-9}$ from $N \to e^\mp \rho^\pm$ and $|U_{\mu N}|^2 < \np{6.2e-8}$ from $N \to \mu^\mp \rho^\pm$; %
among the NC decays $|U_{e N}|^2 < \np{3.7e-9}$ and $|U_{\mu N}|^2 < \np{1.0e-7}$ both from $N \to \nu \phi$.
Even for these channels, there is no sensitivity to CC processes to the tau mixing, %
but interesting limits are set from $N\to \nu\omega$, $\nu\rho^0$ to be respectively %
$|U_{\tau N}|^2 < \np{1.8e-6}$, $\np{8.8e-7}$.

	\label{fig:senseMix}
\end{figure}

In this section we present the bounds in a scenario in which two mixing elements are comparable and dominant over the third one.
This case complements the previous analysis in \refsec{sec:dominant} as, by searching for HNL decays, %
the experiment can constrain certain combinations of the mixing elements.
This can happen when the neutrino is produced via one mixing and decays via another one, %
or when both mixing elements play a role in production and decay.
For instance, the decay $K^+ \to \mu^+ N$ yields heavy neutrinos with a flux proportional to %
$|U_{\mu N}|^2$, but they can afterwards decay into the channel $\nu e^+ e^-$ also via the electronic or the tau mixing.
It is important to highlight that, in the case in which one mixing is responsible for the production and a different mixing for the decay, %
then number of events is proportional to the product of the mixings $|U_{\alpha N}||U_{\beta N}|$ if the studied channel is CC--mediated.
However, if the decay channel is also sensitive to a NC exchange, the number of events is instead proportional to %
$|U_{\alpha N}|\sqrt{|U_{\alpha N}|^2 + |U_{\beta N}|^2}$.
In the remainder of this section, we will use the combination of two mixings represented by $|U_{\alpha N}^* U_{\beta N}|$ %
\enlargethispage{\baselineskip}
for comparing bounds and sensitivity plots.

%However, if two mixings are non-zero, nothing prevents the production and the decay to be mediated by both of them. 
The combinations of mixing terms is relevant to charged Lepton Flavour Violating (cLFV) decays or flavour changing neutral current processes %
which can be enhanced in presence of nearly-sterile neutrinos.
For example, the well-known decay $\mu^+ \to e^+ \gamma$ has a branching ratio which is sensitive to extra neutrino states.
This reads
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:meg}
	\text{Br}(\mu^+ \to e^+ \gamma) = \frac{3 \alpha}{32 \pi} \abs{\sum_i \hat{U}_{\mu i}^*\, \hat{U}_{e i}\,G\qty(\frac{m_i^2}{M_W^2})} \ ,
\end{equation}
where $G(x)$ is the loop function of the process~\cite{Ilakovac:1994kj}.
The current upper limit is set by the MEG experiment to be $\text{Br}(\mu^+ \to e^+\gamma) < \np{4.2e-13}$~\cite{TheMEG:2016wtm}.
Despite being one of the best constrained cLFV process, the bounds on $|U_{e N}^* U_{\mu N}|$ are not as good as the ones imposed %
by other processes, like $\mu \to e e e$ or $\mu - e$ conversion on nuclei~\cite{Alonso:2012ji}.
For instance, the constraint from conversion on Au is $|U_{e N}^* U_{\mu N}| < \np{1.6e-5}$ %
for HNL masses larger than 100\,MeV~\cite{Deshpande:2011uv}.
The branching ratio of other cLFV channels, like $\tau \to e \gamma$ or $\tau \to \mu \gamma$ are not as well constrained %
and so the bounds achievable on the combination of heavy neutrino mixings are expected to be less %
stringent~\cite{Buras:2010cp, Abada:2016vzu}.
Stronger bounds come from study of three-body decays of charm and bottom mesons to charged leptons with different flavour %
and tau decays to pseudo-scalar mesons and a charged lepton: from the search for %
the decay $K \to e \mu \pi$ the bound $|U_{e N}^* U_{\mu N}| < \np{e-9}$ is reached for masses $150\,\text{MeV}\lesssim m_N \lesssim 500\,\text{MeV}$;
%\enlargethispage{\baselineskip}
the decays $\tau \to e \pi \pi$ and $\tau \to \mu \pi\pi$ set the limits
$|U_{e N}^* U_{\tau N}|, |U_{\mu N}^* U_{\tau N}| < \np{5e-6}$ for the respective mass ranges $0.14\,\text{GeV}\lesssim m_N \lesssim 1.7\,\text{GeV}$ and %
$0.24\,\text{GeV}\lesssim m_N \lesssim 1.7\,\text{GeV}$~\cite{Helo:2010cw}.



Instead of dealing with a three-dimensional parameter scan, we simplify the study %
by assigning the same value to the two mixing parameters under consideration.
The number of events is then reported as a function of the neutrino mass and the combination $|U_{\alpha N}^* U_{\beta N}|$.
The results for all channels considered in this work are shown in~\reffig{fig:senseMix}.
The best constraints come again from two-body semi-leptonic decays for all mixing combinations, %
the lowest upper limits being $|U_{e N}^* U_{\mu N}| < \np{6.3e-11}$ at $m_N \simeq 0.37$\,GeV, %
$|U_{\mu N}^* U_{\tau N}| < \np{1.1e-10}$ at $m_N \simeq 0.35$\,GeV, and $|U_{\tau N}^* U_{e N}| < \np{7.4e-11}$ at $m_N \simeq 0.39$\,GeV.
Amongst the three-body leptonic decay channels, $N\to\nu e e$ has the best sensitivity to masses $m_N < m_{K^0}$, %
but actually the mode $N\to \nu e^\mp \mu^\pm$ can be more constraining at higher masses.
Regarding the channels available only above the kaon mass threshold, decays to pseudo-scalar mesons are the most sensitive %
between C processes, whereas the decay $N \to \nu \phi$ gives the best constraint of the NC--mediated channels.
\section{Mass model constraints from DUNE ND}
\label{sec:combined}

%Finally, we make a comparison of this analysis with previous and recent results of beam dump experiment.
%and explain the how the experiment %
%can explore the parameter spaces of different neutrino mass models in the next section, \ref{sec:combined}.

From the results presented in the previous section, we find that the DUNE ND will be sensitive to very low couplings %
for experimentally accessible mass values.
These points of the parameter space corresponds to regions viable in some realisations of low scale neutrino mass models.
In view of the discussion regarding seesaw models in \refsec{sec:model}, we perform a mass matrix random scan to %
define such regions of the parameter space.
Following the previously introduced notation, we focus on three minimal ISS scenarios which predict a HNL with a mass accessible %
by the experiment and that satisfy the experimental evidence of neutrino oscillation~\cite{Abada:2014vea}.
In the first two cases, the heavy neutrino under study belongs to the lightest pseudo-Dirac pair %
of an ISS\,(2,2) and an ISS\,(2,3) realisation; the third scenario is an ISS\,(2,3) case %
in which the fourth Weyl state becomes a Majorana neutrino in the \mbox{MeV--GeV} region thanks to a high LNV parameter.
The details of this analysis are reported in this section, together with the overall sensitivities of DUNE ND to %
heavy neutrino discovery and low scale mass models. 
A comparison with future experiments is also included.

\subsection{Mass model scan}

%The DUNE experiment will be very sensitive to regions of the parameter space of interest with respect to low scale seesaw models.
We have randomly generated neutrino mass matrices and numerically diagonalised them.
The structure of the mass matrix is a generalised version of an ISS:
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{M} = 
	\begin{pmatrix}
		0	& m_D^T	& 0	\\
		m_D	& \mu_R	& M^T_R	\\
		0	& M_R	& \mu_S
	\end{pmatrix}\ ,
\end{equation}
with two LNV submatrices, $\mu_R$ and $\mu_S$.
The number of physical parameters of a ISS\,$(a,b)$ mass matrix is $n_p = 7a + b +2 a\,b$~\cite{Abada:2014vea}. %
We choose a basis in which $m_D$ has complex entries but three of which are real, $M_R$ is diagonal and real, and $\mu_S$ has a real diagonal %
without loss of generality.
If the matrix entries respect the hierarchy \mbox{$\mu_{R,S} \ll m_D \ll M_R$}, the mass spectrum in %
the LNC limit is principally given by the diagonal values of $M_R$.
We then perturb the matrix to achieve the three minimal ISS scenarios introduced above; %
the randomly generated mass matrix $\mathcal{M}$ %
is then diagonalised using the Jacobi Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as implemented in the Eigen library~\cite{Eigen:2010}.
The Takagi decomposition, %
\begin{equation*}
	\hat{U}^T \mathcal{M}\, \hat{U} = \text{diag}(m_1, m_2, m_3, ...)\ ,
\end{equation*}
is retrieved starting from the SVD decomposition $\mathcal{M} = V \Sigma U^\dagger$, %
from which the singular values $\Sigma$ are the non-negative square roots of the eigenvalues of $\mathcal{M}^\dagger \mathcal{M}$ %
and the unitary matrix is $\hat{U} = U \rho^\dagger$, where $\rho = (U^T V)^\frac{1}{2}$ is a unitary phase matrix.

Only matrices satisfying the current constraints on heavy neutral fermions are taken in account.
The first requirement is that the eigenvalues must give the correct mass squared splittings %
compatible within 3$\sigma$ with the measured values~\cite{nufit}.
The condition of matching also the measured mixing angles is relaxed because %
the entries of the PMNS matrix, $\mathcal{U}$, are the result of the random structure of $m_D$ and $\mu_S$.
Constraints on the unitarity of the mixing matrix are applied instead.
The deviation from unitarity are quantified by the following Hermitian matrix:
\begin{equation}
	\varepsilon_{\alpha \beta} \equiv |\delta_{\alpha \beta} - (\mathcal{U}\,\mathcal{U}^\dagger)_{\alpha \beta}| = %
	\abs{\sum_{i=4}^n \hat{U}_{\alpha i} \hat{U}_{\beta i}^*}\ .
\end{equation}
The non-unitarity of the PMNS matrix has been assessed in various experiments, and the constraints depend upon the mass scale of averaged out neutrinos.
For neutrino masses below the GeV scale, but heavy enough to decouple from flavour oscillations, %
non-unitarity effects are tested in neutrino oscillation experiment as an overall normalisation.
If the neutrino mass is above the GeV scale, electroweak precision experiments provide strong constraints on non-unitarity.
The constraints are summarised below (from~\refref{Antusch:2008tz, Fernandez-Martinez:2016lgt, Blennow:2016jkn})
\begin{align*}
	&\varepsilon_{\alpha \beta} <
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\np{2.4e-2}	& \np{1.3e-2}	& \np{3.5e-2}	\\
		\cdot		& \np{2.2e-2}	& \np{6.0e-3}	\\
		\cdot		& \cdot		& \np{1.0e-1}
	\end{pmatrix}\quad 
	\text{if 10\,eV} \lesssim m_N \lesssim \text{1\,GeV}\ ,\\
	&\varepsilon_{\alpha \beta} <
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\np{1.3e-3}	& \np{1.2e-5}	& \np{1.4e-3}	\\
		\cdot		& \np{2.2e-4}	& \np{6.0e-4}	\\
		\cdot		& \cdot		& \np{2.8e-3}
	\end{pmatrix}\quad
	\text{if}\ m_N \gtrsim \text{1\,GeV}\ .
\end{align*}

The $\mu_R$ and $\mu_S$ entries of the ISS matrices naturally lead to lepton flavour and lepton number violating processes.
The most constrained process is the decay rate of \mbox{$\mu^+ \to e^+\gamma$}, the branching ratio of which is given in \refeq{eq:meg}.
The current upper limit on the branching ratio is \np{4.2e-13}, but a future upgrade of the experiment %
foresees to reach a limit lower than \np{5e-14}.

Heavy neutrinos in a ISS model also contribute to the neutrinoless double beta decay.
The effective neutrino mass $m_{\beta\beta}$ receives further corrections with respect %
to the standard expression as
\begin{equation}
	m_{\beta\beta} \simeq \abs{\sum_i \hat{U}_{e i}^2 \frac{p^2\,m_i}{p^2 - m_i^2}}
\end{equation}
where $p^2 \simeq -\np{0.015}$\,GeV\tapi{2} is the typical virtual momentum of the exchanged neutrino.
The~contribution from masses above the 100\,MeV scale drops as $\flatfrac{1}{m^2_i}$ while it is constant for masses below~\cite{Blennow:2010th}.
It is interesting to note that the contributions given by pseudo-Dirac pairs are subject to partial cancellation, regulated by the LNV parameters.
In the LNC limit, the cancellation is maximum and the paired states do not take part in the $0\nu\beta\beta$ process.
The latest result from the KamLAND-Zen experiment~\cite{KamLAND-Zen:2016pfg} is interpreted as~\mbox{$m_{\beta\beta} < 61$\,meV}.
%The latest result from the GERDA experiment~\cite{Agostini:2017iyd} is interpreted as $m_{\beta\beta} < 150$\,meV.

We find, for the first two ISS scenarios, that the allowed ranges span in the space %
\mbox{$m_D \sim 10^{[3,6]}$\,eV}, \mbox{$M_R \sim 10^{[6,15]}$\,eV}, $\mu_S$ and $\mu_R \sim 10^{[-4,1]}$\,eV.
We check that each matrix generated respects the \emph{naturalness condition} in the 't Hooft sense~\cite{tHooft:1980xss} %
and that the mass spectrum presents a mass state accessible by the DUNE experiment.
For the third ISS case, large entries of the sub-matrix $\mu_S$ are necessary to give the Majorana state a mass that %
can be probed by the experiment.
We find the ranges of \mbox{$m_D \sim 10^{[3,10]}$\,eV}, $M_R \sim 10^{[7,15]}$\,eV, $\mu_S \sim 10^{[4,9]}$\,eV to respect %
the constraints.
The hierarchy and naturalness conditions are relaxed in this case.
It is found that the block $\mu_R$ does not influence the final mass spectrum; %
it usually gives contribution to the light neutrino masses at the loop level, in a region below the GeV scale that has been already excluded by experiments.
%The neutrino masses and the mixing elements are extracted from the mass matrices that survive all the experimental constraints.
The resulting points in the space $(m_N, |U_{\alpha N}|^2)$ are clustered together and the regions defined are overlaid in \reffig{fig:sensAll}.
Any combination of mass and mixing element inside these areas can be justified by a valid neutrino mass matrix %
which can explain the light neutrino masses and survive the experimental constraints.
The pseudo-Dirac pairs from the ISS\,(2,2) and ISS\,(2,3) scenarios give very similar regions, %
but Majorana states from the ISS\,(2,3) realisation can only be generated with very small couplings.
A type I seesaw band, corresponding to light neutrino mass between 20~meV and 200~meV, %
is plotted as well for comparison.

\subsection{Overall sensitivity}

We define the overall sensitivity of DUNE ND to the discovery of HNL as the combination of the sensitivities to selected channels, %
presented in \refsec{sec:results}.
These channels are $N\to\nu e e$, $\nu e \mu$, $\nu \mu \mu$, $\nu \pi^0$, $e \pi$, $\mu \pi$ and are preferred because of %
their good discovery prospect, for which backgrounds have also been studied.
They all give strong sensitivities, especially for masses below 500\,MeV.
Their reach is due to high branching ratios and also to clean and well-defined signatures in the detector, %
allowing the background to be controlled with sufficient precision.
The neutrino spectrum component coming from the $D_s$ meson allows for weaker sensitivity %
to masses above the neutral kaon mass.
We conducted the sensitivity study for both scenarios, in which either a Majorana or a Dirac neutrino is the decaying particle.

	\label{fig:sensAll}
\end{figure}

To appreciate the ND performance, we make a comparison with results of previous experiments, %
in particular PS191~\cite{Bernardi:1985ny, Bernardi:1987ek}, peak searches~\cite{Artamonov:2014urb, Britton:1992pg, Britton:1992xv}, %
CHARM~\cite{Vilain:1994vg}, NuTeV~\cite{Vaitaitis:1999wq}, DELPHI~\cite{Abreu:1996pa}, and T2K~\cite{Abe:2019kgx}.
We find that the DUNE ND can increase the bound on the electronic and muonic mixing elements %
for masses $m_N < m_{K^0}$ with respect to previous experiments.
The constraint on the tauonic mixing is at least comparable with previous results.
For masses above, for which neutrino production relies on charm meson decays, the existing bounds %
are improved for the electronic mixing and the tauonic mixing, while a conservative result %
can be achieved in the muonic case.
We also overlay the prospects for the SBN programme~\cite{Ballett:2016opr}, %
NA62~\cite{Drewes:2018irr}, and the proposed SHiP~\cite{Alekhin:2015byh} and FASER~\cite{Kling:2018wct} with 1\,m radius.
DUNE ND will give the best sensitivity for masses below the 500\,MeV in all channels, but the tauonic one.
However, anywhere the $D_s$ meson production is involved, the experiment cannot outperform the predicted %
sensitivity of the SHiP experiment which will deploy a 400\,GeV proton beam on a titanium-zinc-molybdenum alloy %
target, enhancing the production of charm and bottom mesons.
NA62 gives better results for the $|U_{\mu N}|^2$ mixing, but DUNE has a better sensitivity %
to the electron and tau channels.
FASER is comparable to NA62 in sensitivity, but it can reach regions of the parameter space beyond the 2\,GeV limit %
to which DUNE is not sensitive.

We then compare the overall sensitivity to regions allowed by neutrino mass models.
In the electronic and muonic channels, DUNE ND will be sensitive to a large part of the pseudo-Dirac regions, %
corresponding to ISS\,(2,2) and ISS\,(2,3) models, %
part of which have been already excluded by past experiments.
DUNE will close the gap and put to test type I seesaw parameters, especially for HNL masses between 200 and 500\,MeV, %
starting to reach the region of ISS\,(2,3) with large lepton number violation.
For the tauonic channel, the experiment will probe only a small portion %
of pseudo-Dirac pairs from ISS\,(2,2) and ISS\,(2,3) models.
The sensitivity is not high enough to reach type I and Majorana state regions, which not even the dedicated experiment SHiP can.

	\label{fig:sblosc}
\end{figure}

The ISS\,(2,3) scenario in which the pseudo-Dirac pair is accessible by the experiment also predicts a light %
Majorana state, the mass of which is controlled by the small LNV perturbations.
This entails the presence of a third mass splitting $\Delta m^2_{4 1}$, which could give %
an active-sterile oscillation signature in short baseline experiments.
In figure Fig.~\ref{fig:sblosc}, the new mass splitting is plotted against the mixings $|U_{e 4}|^2$, %
$|U_{\mu 4}|^2$ and the combination usually referred to as %
$\sin^2 2\theta_{\mu e} \equiv 4 |U_{e 4}|^2|U_{\mu 4}|^2$.
The mass splittings generated in the matrix scan span from %
$\Delta m^2_{3 1} \simeq \np{0.0025}$\,eV\tapi{2} up to \np{e4}\,eV\tapi{2}, and the squared mixings cover a large region, %
down to \np{e-14} for all the flavours.
The reactor anomalies could be soon excluded at the 90\,\% C.L. by the DANSS experiment~\cite{Alekseev:2018efk} %
and the allowed regions from LSND~\cite{Aguilar:2001ty} and %
MiniBooNE~\cite{Aguilar-Arevalo:2012fmn, Aguilar-Arevalo:2013pmq, Aguilar-Arevalo:2018gpe} %
require values of $\sin^2 2\theta_{\mu e} \gtrsim \np{e-3}$.
Given the results of the matrix scan, it is unlikely that one of the ISS\,(2,3) realisations %
considered in this work could link an heavy neutrino--like signal in DUNE ND and explain a short baseline anomaly at the same time, %
\enlargethispage{\baselineskip}
unless for sparse and very fine-tuned points.


\section{Background reduction}
\label{sec:appbackground}

We performed a background analysis only for the decay channels with an important discovery potential, %
and these are $N \to \nu e^+ e^-$, $\nu e^\pm \mu^\mp$, $\nu \mu^+\mu^-$, $\nu\pi^0$, $e^\mp\pi^\pm$, and $\mu^\mp\pi^\pm$. 
The advantage of these channels is that they give the best sensitivities to new physics, thanks to both their %
high branching ratios and the flux intensity in the region of interest.
Moreover, the final state particle are all well-studied particles, most of which leave clean tracks in the detector.
As an example of the background reduction using kinematic cuts, we present here the background analysis for %
a sterile neutrino with mass $m_N = 300$\,MeV.

With respect to the following tables, the values presented are in the form ``$\mathcal{X} \to \mathcal{Y}$'', %
where $\mathcal{X}$ is the per mille (\np{e-3}) fraction of background events %
from mis-identification and $\mathcal{Y}$ is the per mille fraction of irreducible background %
after the application of data cuts based on kinematic properties.
When the value $\np{0e-3}$ is shown, we mean that less than one background event per million is expected.
The average was computed by weighting the flux components contribution to the background, using the %
respective interaction rate as weights, reported in Tab.~\ref{tab:rate}.
We assume that the $\nu_\tau$ and $\cj{\nu}_\tau$ components are not responsible for background events, therefore only the $\nu_e$, $\nu_\mu$, %
and $\cj{\nu}_\mu$ components are studied.
The last two rows of the tables are the percentage of signal events retained, after the kinematic cuts are applied %
to the MC simulation of Majorana and Dirac neutrinos.
Because of the overwhelming background, the number of signal events are most of the time substantially influenced.

We group the studied channels in three categories, which have similar kinematic features: %
two-body decay, which are semi-leptonic, three-body decay channels, which are purely leptonic instead, and %
decays which can be only detected via photon reconstruction.
%We limit our analysis only for events with a total energy greater than 5~GeV, unless stated differently.

\subsection{Two-body decays}

The two-body decays $N \to e^\pm \pi^\mp$ and $N \to \mu^\pm \pi^\mp$ are the most promising channels for the detection %
of a heavy neutrino, being the decay mode with the highest branching ratios.
The typical signal is a two charged particle tracks with a common vertex, in a $V^0$-like fashion.
Muons and pions leave a clean signature in the fine grained tracker and the LArTPC, %
and electrons are easily reconstructed.
They give direct information on the parent particle, being the invariant mass of the process the %
same as the mass of the decaying neutrino, $m_N^2 = s = m_\ell^2 + m_\pi^2 + 2E_\ell E_\pi - 2|\vb{p}_\ell| |\vb{p}_\pi| \cos \theta$, %
where $\theta$ is the opening angle between the lepton and the pion.
Moreover, the two particles are emitted back-to-back in the neutrino reference frame, and, once the system %
is boosted in the direction of the decaying neutrino, the relative position on the perpendicular plane %
is preserved.
The CC interactions of $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu$ are the main background processes, %
because additional photons or pions can be mis-identified for electrons or muons.
We therefore cut on the separation angle between the charged particles, which are very boosted forward, %
and we request that they are in opposite direction on the plane perpendicular to the beamline.
An energy threshold on the reconstructed neutrino, above 5\,GeV, is also imposed, %
as the background events peak at lower energies.
The background events are reduced up to a factor $\mathcal{O}(\np{e4})$, %
whereas $\sim$46\,\% of the Majorana neutrino events and $\sim$40\,\% of the Dirac neutrino events lie above the cuts.

\subsection{Three-body decays}

The three-body decays studied are $N\to \nu e^- e^+$, $N\to \nu e^\mp \mu^\pm$, and $N\to \nu \mu^- \mu^+$.
The~principle sources of background are mis-reconstructed photons, which promptly converts to electron-positron pairs, %
or pion tracks that are too long and identified as muons.
Despite this, the mis-ID rate is already low as two leptons are needed to identify these channels.
However, the background analysis in the case of three-body decays is further complicated by the loss of the light neutrino %
and so direct information on the parent particle may not be recovered; %
there is some missing transverse momentum, even though small because of the neutrino lightness.
Cuts on the distribution of the transverse momenta of electrons and muons can therefore help reject background events, %
which deviate from the beam line direction.
We find, nonetheless, that cuts on the invariant mass of the charged lepton system %
\enlargethispage{\baselineskip}
are useful to discriminate signal from background.
The energy range considered for the lepton-pairs is different for the channels $\nu e^- e^+$ ($E_{ee} > 2$\,GeV), %
$\nu e^\mp \mu^\pm$ ($E_{e\mu} > 4$\,GeV), and $\nu \mu^-\mu^+$ ($E_{\mu\mu} > 5$\,GeV), %
due to  different distributions of the background energy spectra in the three cases.
The cuts applied to the two-electron channel are the ones with the highest signal selection efficiency, %
yet reducing the background by a factor $\sim200$.
On the contrary, the two-muon channel has the highest mis-identification rate, %
and so the worst selection success for three-body decays.
The electron--muon channel lies in between the other two, presenting though the lowest mis-ID rate. 
The slightly different behaviours between the kinematics of Majorana and Dirac neutrinos is emphasised %
by the selection efficiencies of the $\nu e^- e^+$ channel.
This tendency is lost as the signal efficiency decreases in the other two channels.

\subsection{EM--detected decays}

The semi-leptonic decay $N \to \nu \pi^0$ may only be identified by a correct photon reconstruction, %
since the neutral pion decays almost 100\,\% of the time in two photons.
This particle is extensively produced in CC and NC neutrino-nucleon interactions, %
while individual photon background is due to badly reconstructed EM showers, %
occurring especially in $\nu_e$--CC interactions.
If a pair of $\gamma$ is detected and their invariant mass is compatible with $m_{\pi^0}$, %
the parent pion is reconstructed.
Afterwards, we compare the transverse momenta of the single photons with the transverse momentum %
of their parent particle, and we set constraints on the separation angle between the two $\gamma$.
We consider only photons with an energy greater than 1\,GeV, to avoid the dominant low-energy background.
The selection cuts results to be more severe for this mode, leaving signal events just below 20\,\%, %
but obtaining a reasonable background reduction of a factor of 500.
This detection channel is the most challenging, among those studied, because of the multiple background sources.
However, it is one of the decay modes with the highest branching ratio, and with advanced and dedicated techniques~\cite{Ankowski:2008aa, Back:2012wc}
the reconstruction efficiency can be improved, as well as the background rejection.
