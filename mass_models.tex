\chapter{Phenomenology of heavy neutral leptons}
\label{cha:mass_models}

The evidence of three neutrino flavour oscillation is well established~\cite{Fukuda:1998mi,Aharmim:2005gt, Esteban:2018azc} %
and necessarily implies that the neutrino mass splittings are nonzero, as seen in \refsec{sec:neutrino_vacuum}.
Neutrinos are therefore massive and they mix, forcing to consider extensions of the Standard Model (SM) to explain their origin. 
A simple means of doing so is to introduce the right-handed counterpart of SM neutrinos (see \refsec{sec:neutrino_mixing}) %
which are singlet with respect to all SM gauge symmetries.
The new Lagrangian includes a Yukawa coupling between these sterile states, the Higgs boson and the leptonic doublet, %
which generates Dirac mass-terms below the scale of electro-weak symmetry breaking (EWSB).
Since any renormalisable term should be included in the Lagrangian, %
Majorana mass terms for the new singlet states are allowed.
On diagonalisation of the resulting neutrino mass matrix, the heavy neutrino states, %
commonly known as nearly-sterile neutrinos or Heavy Neutral Leptons (HNLs) in experimental contexts, %
remain mainly in the sterile neutrino direction and have subweak interactions suppressed by %
elements of the extended mixing matrix. 

These states have been connected to a vast range of phenomenological behaviours and %
even to cosmological implications (for a review on sterile neutrinos see \refref{Abazajian:2012ys}).
For instance, nearly-sterile neutrinos in the keV region are viable warm dark matter candidates~\cite{Asaka:2005an}, %
whereas heavier HNLs could play a role in leptogenesis~\cite{Fukugita:1986hr, Covi:1996wh, Pilaftsis:1997jf}.
%Buchmuller:1997yu, %

%Hambye:2016sby, Hambye:2017elz, Drewes:2017zyw
So far, some possible hints in favour of sterile neutrinos have emerged in neutrino appearance oscillation experiments, %
specifically LSND~\cite{Aguilar:2001ty} and MiniBooNE~\cite{Aguilar-Arevalo:2012fmn, Aguilar-Arevalo:2013pmq, Aguilar-Arevalo:2018gpe} %
but are disfavoured by disappearance experiments~\cite{TheIceCube:2016oqi, Adamson:2017uda, Aartsen:2017bap}, %
unless non-standard effects are present~\cite{Liao:2016reh, Liao:2018mbg, Esmaili:2018qzu, Denton:2018dqq}.
Further hints in the same mass range have been reported for mixing with electron neutrinos in the %
so-called reactor anomaly~\cite{Mueller:2011nm, Mention:2011rk, Huber:2011wv, Ko:2016owz, Alekseev:2018efk} %
and in the less statistically significant gallium one~\cite{Abdurashitov:2005tb, Laveder:2007zz, Giunti:2006bj}.
Explanations of the MiniBooNE low energy excess invoking GeV-scale HNLs with nonstandard %
interactions~\cite{Gninenko:2009ks, Gninenko:2010pr, Masip:2012ke, Bertuzzo:2018itn, Ballett:2018ynz} %
have also been put forward.
In these models, heavy neutral fermions are produced by neutrino up-scattering in the detector %
and subsequently decay into photons or electrons, which mimic an electron neutrino interaction.
The interpretation of the current experimental results is still largely debated in the scientific community.
Searches both for electron-like signatures in MicroBooNE, the SBN programme at Fermilab~\cite{Antonello:2015lea}, %
and in short baseline reactor neutrino experiments, such as DANNS~\cite{Alekseev:2018efk}, NEOS~\cite{Ko:2016owz}, %
PROSPECT~\cite{Ashenfelter:2018iov}, STEREO~\cite{Almazan:2018wln}, and \mbox{NEUTRINO-4}~\cite{Serebrov:2018vdw}, %
will shed further light on these possibilities, %
whereas the KATRIN experiments~\cite{Mertens:2018vuu} will be able to exclude the gallium anomalies.

Apart from these controversial hints, no positive evidence of heavy neutrinos has been found to date in laboratory searches.
Bounds critically depend on the HNL masses and the flavour with which they mix.
Searches for kinks in Curie plots of $\beta$-decay spectra~\cite{Galeazzi:2001py, Hiddemann:1995ce, Holzschuh:1999vy, %
Holzschuh:2000nj, Deutsch:1990ut} have placed bounds on the electronic mixing for HNL masses between the keV and MeV scales.  
%
For masses from a few MeV to a few hundreds MeV, searches for monochromatic peaks %
in the lepton spectrum of decaying pions and kaons place important bounds on the muonic and %
electronic mixing angles~\cite{Artamonov:2014urb, Britton:1992pg, Britton:1992xv, Aguilar-Arevalo:2017vlf, Aguilar-Arevalo:2019owf}.
Neutrinoless double beta decay indirectly constrains Majorana HNLs from the eV to the TeV scale %
and lepton number violating meson and tau decays can be used to set limits on the mixing angle %
in narrow ranges of HNLs masses~\cite{Atre:2009rg}. 
%
%
The tightest constraints come from searches for the direct production and subsequent decays of heavy neutrinos %
in \emph{beam dump} experiments (see \refcha{cha:hnl_dune}) and at colliders.
These types of studies are almost model independent and thus can provide competitive bounds. 
The strongest limits to date were set by the PS191 experiment~\cite{Bernardi:1985ny, Bernardi:1987ek}, %
even though a similar search in the near detector of T2K has reached very similar constraints~\cite{Abe:2019kgx}.
%a beam dump experiment which ran at CERN in 1984.
%Its most stringent upper bounds on the novel mixing angles are \mbox{$|U_{e4}|^2, |U_{\mu4}|^2 \leq \np{e-8} \text{\,--\,} \np{e-9}$} %
%for neutrino masses between the pion and the kaon mass.
Other bounds of this type can be found at LEP experiments~\cite{Abreu:1996pa, Adriani:1992pq}, CHARM II~\cite{Vilain:1994vg}, %
NuTeV~\cite{Vaitaitis:1999wq}, and similar ones~\cite{Badier:1985wg, CooperSarkar:1985nh, Gallas:1994xp}, %
as well as collider analyses, from LHCb~\cite{Aaij:2014aba}, ATLAS~\cite{Aaboud:2018spl}, CMS~\cite{Sirunyan:2018mtv, Sirunyan:2018xiv}, %
BELLE~\cite{Liventsev:2013zz} (see also \refref{Harrison:2015bja}).
Thorough reviews of the current experimental constraints can be found in~\refrefs{Atre:2009rg, Drewes:2015iva}, %
and in \refref{Ruchayskiy:2011aa} for some revised bounds. 

% Similarly, peak searches in leptonic decays
%at rest of pions and kaons have proved to be a very powerful probe of the
%mixing of heavy neutrinos with both $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu$.  If a heavy
%neutrino is produced in such decays, the lepton spectrum would show a
%monochromatic line at % \begin{equation} % E_\ell = \frac{M_0^2 + m_\ell^2 -
%m_N^2}{2 M_0} % \end{equation} % where $M_0$ is the decaying meson mass and
%$m_\ell$ the associated lepton.  Different experiments
%{E949~\cite{Artamonov:2014urb}, PIENU~\cite{PIENU:2011aa},
%TRIUMF~\cite{Britton:1992pg}~\cite{Britton:1992xv}} studied $\pi$ and $K$
%decays placing robust bounds.  % Searches for kinks in Curie plots of
%$\beta$-decay spectra~\cite{Galeazzi:2001py, Hiddemann:1995ce,
%Holzschuh:1999vy, Holzschuh:2000nj, Deutsch:1990ut} and studies of
%$0\nu\beta\beta$~\cite{Benes:2005hn} have placed bounds on the electronic
%mixing.  % A thorough review of the current constraints is found
%in~\cite{Atre:2009rg, Drewes:2015iva}.
%



%Ultimately, we show that DUNE will mostly (but not exclusively) be sensitive to pseudo-Dirac states.
%and this can have consequence for the signal and analysis strategies adopted by the collaboration.
%Also by considering the relationship between low-scale steriles and neutrino masses, %
%our predictions from DUNE can be correlated with constraints from other experiments such as searches for LNV and NSIs/non-unitarity.

In this chapter, low-scale seesaw models are discussed linking the origin of light neutrinos to %
a new phenomenologically viable physics scale in \refsec{sec:model}.
This elegant solution is possible thanks to a minimal extension of the SM symmetry, %
in which heavy neutral leptons are predicted at an energy range accessible by future neutrino experiments (see \refcha{cha:hnl_dune}).
Formulae to compute polarised differential rates were computed for the first time in literature %
in \refref{Ballett:2019bgd} and are reported in \refsec{sec:decay} and \refsec{sec:production}.
The precise formulation of decay and production rates is necessary %
to develop a reliable study of searches of HNL decays at neutrino beam facilities.
The range of interest for this study goes therefore from a few MeV up to a couple of GeV, %
as motivated in \refsec{sec:production}.

\section{Heavy neutrinos in seesaw models}
\label{sec:model}

Given $n$ new SM singlets, $N_i$, the extended Lagrangian becomes
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:newmodel}
	\mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}+\mathcal{N}} = \mathcal{L}_\text{SM} + i\, \cj{N}_i\, \sh{\pd}\, N_i + %
			Y_{\alpha i}\, \cj{L}_\alpha\, \widetilde{H}\, N_i + %
			\frac{1}{2} (M_R)_{ij}\, \cj{N^C}_i\, N_j + \text{h.c.}\ ,
	%\mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}+N} = \mathcal{L}_\text{SM} + i \cj{N}_i \sh{\pd} N_i + Y_{\alpha i} \cj{L}_\alpha \tilde{H} N_i %
	%+ \frac{1}{2} (M_R)_{ij} \cj{N^c}_i N_j + \text{h.c.}\ ,
\end{equation}
with $\mathcal{L}_\text{SM}$ denoting the SM Lagrangian and the other symbols taking their conventional meaning.
Below EWSB, mass terms for neutrino states become explicitly available
\begin{equation}
	- \mathcal{L}_\text{mass} = \frac{1}{2}\, \cj{\bs{\nu}}\, \mathcal{M}\, \bs{\nu}^C + h.c.\ ,
\end{equation}
where $\bs{\nu}$ is such that %
\begin{equation}
	P_L\,\bs{\nu} \equiv (\nu_e, \nu_\mu, \nu_\tau, N_1, \ldots, N_n)\ ,
\end{equation}
and $C$ denotes charge-conjugation (see \refsec{sec:cp_oscillation}).
If no additional field content is added and only renormalisable operators are included, %
the low-scale mass terms will have the structure
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:mass_matrix}
	\mathcal{M} = \mqty( 0	& m_D^T	\\ m_D	& M_R )\ ,
\end{equation}
where $m_D$ and $M_R$ are complex matrices of dimensions $n\times 3$ and $n \times n$, respectively.
Under the assumption that $M_R$ is full rank, this model defines the Type I %
seesaw~\cite{Minkowski:1977sc, Mohapatra:1979ia, GellMann:1980vs, Yanagida:1979as}.
The light neutrino mass matrix is then retrieved by the following expansion~\cite{Grimus:2000vj}:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:typeI_seesaw}
	m_\nu = m_D^TM_R^{-1}m_D + \mathcal{O}\qty(\qty[M_R^{-1}m_D]^2)\ .
\end{equation}
The top-left zero in \refeq{eq:mass_matrix} arises as a consequence of $\text{SU(2)}_L$ symmetry, %
and similar theoretical considerations often impose further textures and hierarchies on $m_D$ and $M_R$, %
which in turn lead to specific correlations in the physical spectrum of states.
The heavy neutrino masses are approximately given by the diagonal entries of $M_R$ and its corresponding eigenstates, %
the heavy nearly-sterile neutrinos $N_i$, have suppressed mixing with active neutrinos and are mainly composed %
by sterile fields.
Neglecting the matrix nature of these expressions for now, if $m_D$ takes values around the electroweak scale, %
acceptable neutrino masses are produced when $M_R$ has values around the GUT scale, %
suggestively connecting it to a high-scale breaking of $U(1)_{B-L}$~\cite{Minkowski:1977sc}.
Low-scale solutions are also possible by taking the Yukawa couplings to be similar %
or smaller than the other SM lepton Yukawa couplings.
For example if $m_D$ takes values in the keV range, new nearly-sterile states would exist with masses around a GeV.
The resulting mixing $U_{\alpha N}$ is constrained by the contribution given to light neutrino masses %
and naively one can expect to have
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:TypeI_mixing_bound}
	\qty|U_{\alpha N}|^2 \lesssim \frac{m_\nu}{m_N} \lesssim  \np{e-10}\ \frac{1\,\mathrm{GeV}}{m_N}\ ,
	%
\end{equation}
by taking $m_\nu\lesssim 0.1$\,eV as limit for light neutrino masses and with $m_N$ the mass of a heavy neutrino.
Specific models in which low energy neutrino masses and mixing angles are derived from the seesaw parameters %
allow for a broader range of values, invoking specific structures for the Yukawa couplings.

Another way to avoid the bound of \refeq{eq:TypeI_mixing_bound} %
is by the cancellation between contributions to neutrino masses from larger families of sterile neutrinos.
This is achieved in a class of models with approximate lepton number (LN), %
which can lead to phenomenologically acceptable neutrino masses.
Assuming that all of the $N_i$ states have lepton numbers of $|Q_L| = 1$,
the right-handed fields $S_j = N_j^C$ are defined for any state with $Q_L = -1$.
The set of flavour states can then be ordered by lepton number
\begin{equation}
	P_L\,\bs{\nu} \equiv (\nu_e, \nu_\mu, \nu_\tau, N_1, \ldots, N_a, S^C_1, \ldots, S^C_b)\ ,
\end{equation}
with $a+b=n$.
These charge assignments forbid certain terms in the mass matrix, when LN is conserved.
Following \refeq{eq:newmodel} and \refeq{eq:mass_matrix}, the most general mass matrix is given when
\begin{equation}
	m_D = \mqty(m, 0) \qquad \text{and}\qquad M_R = %
	\mqty(0 & M^\text{T} \\ M & 0)\ ,
\end{equation}
producing in the lepton number conserving (LNC) limit
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:iss_matrix_lnc}
	\mathcal{M} = 
	\mqty( 0	& m^T	& 0	\\
	       m	& 0	    & M \\
	       0	& M^T	& 0)\ ,
\end{equation}
where $m$ and $M$ are complex matrices with respectively dimensions $a\times 3$ and $a\times b$.
This matrix preserves LN and all its flavour states have nonzero LN.
It is found that the mass spectrum, i.e.\ the entries of the diagonalised matrix, consists of~\cite{Wyler:1982dd}
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:LNC_spectrum}
      	\text{min}\{3+b,a\}~\text{Dirac pairs} \qquad\text{and}\qquad |3+b-a|~\text{massless Majorana states}\ , 
\end{equation}
in which the Dirac pair masses are given by the nonzero singular values of the rectangular %
$a \times (3+b)$ matrix $(m^\text{T}, M^\text{T})$.
Although such a mass matrix can explain the neutrino data via three Dirac pairs with $a=3$ and $b=0$, %
this solution has no natural explanation of the observed smallness of the light neutrinos.
The scale of neutrino masses can be recovered by a perturbation of  %
the above mass matrix by means of a small lepton number violating (LNV) parameter.
In this case, the specific texture of $M_R$ and $m_D$ guarantees a quasi-preserved LN if %
the LNV parameters are natural in the 't Hooft sense~\cite{tHooft:1980xss}.
This can lift eigenstates which are massless in the LNC limit to states %
with small masses, the magnitude of which is dictated by the LNV perturbation.
Under assumptions of renormalisability, the most general LNV Lagrangian must include the following terms,
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:lagrangian_LNV}
	\mathcal{L}_\text{LNV} = - Y_{\alpha i}^\prime\, \cj{L_\alpha}\,H\, S_i %
				-\frac{1}{2}\mu^\prime_{ij}\,\cj{N_i^C}\, N_j %
				-\frac{1}{2}\mu_{ij}\,\cj{S_i^C}\, S_j\ .
\end{equation}
Each of the terms in this Lagrangian has historically been associated with a %
simple independent implementation of the paradigm:
the Inverse Seesaw~(ISS)~\cite{Mohapatra:1986bd, GonzalezGarcia:1988rw}, %
the linear seesaw~\cite{Wyler:1982dd,Akhmedov:1995ip,Akhmedov:1995vm}, %
and the extended seesaw~\cite{Barr:2003nn, Kang:2006sn}.
The focus of this thesis is on the ISS model.


\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{pics/ISS_masses.pdf}
	\caption[Schematic for LNV dependency of mass spectrum in an inverse seesaw model]%
		{This schematic shows the different structure of the neutrino mass spectrum when %
			LNV terms are included or not in the mass matrix.
			As an example, ISS(2,2) and ISS(2,3) models are shown.
			In the LNC limit, the high scale masses are degenerate and the states form Dirac pairs, %
			whereas the light neutrinos are all massless Weyl states. 
			When the LNV perturbation $\mu$ is added, the degeneracy is resolved %
			and the Dirac pairs become pseudo-Dirac states, with a mass splitting proportional to $\mu$ .
			At the low scale, the neutrinos also acquire masses.
			When $a\neq b$ extra Majorana states appear in addition to the three light neutrinos.
		}
	\label{fig:iss_spectrum}
\end{figure}

In the ISS, the texture of the perturbation assumes the values $Y^\prime = 0$ and $\mu^\prime=0$, %
while $\mu$ controls the size of LNV effects.
The mass matrix is therefore
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:iss_matrix_lnv}
	\mathcal{M} = 
	\mqty(
		0	& m_D^T	& 0	\\
		m_D	& 0	& M^T_R	\\
		0	& M_R	& \mu
	)\ .
\end{equation}
On diagonalisation, the light neutrino masses are found to be suppressed by the size of~$\mu$.
Assuming $\mu \ll m , M$  and $a=b$, the light mass matrix takes the following form~\cite{GonzalezGarcia:1988rw}:
\begin{equation}
	m_\nu = m\, M^{-1} \mu \qty(M^{-1})^T m^T + \mathcal{O}(\mu^2)\ .
\end{equation}
It results that light neutrino masses are explained by Yukawa couplings of order one and %
a new physics scale a little above the electroweak scale~\cite{Mohapatra:1986bd, GonzalezGarcia:1988rw}. 
For $a\neq b$, extra massless sterile states degenerate with the light neutrinos are present %
in addition to the set of Dirac pairs of arbitrary masses.
In the LNC limit, there is no mixing defined that involves these degenerate states, %
as any unitary map in the degenerate subspace is permitted.
On the contrary, the introduction of the small LNV parameter $\mu$ perturbs the LNC spectrum as well as the mixing %
for both light and heavy neutrinos.
In general, there are only two possible origins for a low-scale heavy neutrino.
One scenario is when one of the massive Dirac pair is already at a low energy scale in the LNC limit %
and it becomes a pseudo-Dirac pair after the perturbation.
The degeneracy is resolved by the $\mu$ parameter, which regulates the mass splitting of the pair.
Both in the LNC limit and in the LNV case, the mixing angles between Dirac pair and light neutrinos can be arbitrarily large.
The other possibility can only occur when $a\neq b$ and it involves one of the massless Majorana fermion, %
initially degenerate with the light neutrinos.
In the presence of LNV terms, this state is given a nonzero mass proportional to the perturbation.
As the mixing between massless states is not defined in the LNC limit, the perturbation controls %
the induced mixing between the nearly-sterile state and the active ones.
The cartoon of \reffig{fig:iss_spectrum} illustrates how the mass spectrum changes with LNV terms, %
highlighting how the mass degeneracy in the LNC limit is resolved when LNV contributions are added.
The notation ``ISS\,$(a,b)$'' will be used to denote a realisation of the model with $a$ and $b$ new gauge singlets of, %
respectively, lepton number $+1$ and $-1$, and $a, b \neq 0$.

The discussion above suggests that both Majorana states and \mbox{(pseudo-)Dirac} states should be considered %
when dealing with possible phenomenological aspects of an ISS framework.
In computing decay and production rates for both Majorana states and Dirac states, %
lepton number violating effects will be disregarded and therefore the distinction between pseudo-Dirac %
and Dirac states will not be relevant.
The region of interest for the masses of heavy states is in the MeV--GeV range.
This is motivated by the kinematic limits on production from meson decays discussed in more detail in \refsec{sec:production}. %
Feynman rules for Majorana states derived from \refeq{eq:newmodel} can be found in~\cite{Atre:2009rg},
or constructed using the techniques of \refref{Denner:1992me}. 
For an explicit comparison between Dirac versus Majorana Feynman rules for heavy neutrinos, see~\refref{Abada:2016plb}.




%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\iffalse
The lightness of the observed neutrino masses can be explained in a range of different scenarios. %
New SM--gauge singlet fermions are a feature common to many of them. 
Without loss of generality, the mass matrix of $M_R$ \refeq{eq:newmodel} can be chosen to be diagonal.
After electroweak symmetry breaking, a Dirac mass emerges for which the notation $m_D \equiv v Y/\sqrt{2}$ will be used.
%
This term appears, for instance, in the famous Type I seesaw mechanism~\cite{Minkowski:1977sc,Mohapatra:1979ia,GellMann:1980vs,Yanagida:1979as}. %
Majorana masses for the light neutrinos arise and are given by
%
\begin{equation}
	m_\nu = -m_D M_R^{-1} m_D^T + \mathcal{O}\qty(\qty[m_D M_R^{-1}]^2)\ .
\end{equation}
%
The heavy neutrino masses are approximately given by the diagonal entries of $M_R$ and its corresponding eigenstates, %
the heavy nearly-sterile neutrinos $N_i$, have suppressed mixing with active neutrinos and are mainly composed %
by sterile fields.
Neglecting the matrix nature of these expressions for now, if $m_D$ takes values around the electroweak scale, %
acceptable neutrino masses are produced when $M_R$ has values around the GUT scale, %
suggestively connecting it to a high-scale breaking of $U(1)_{B-L}$~\cite{Minkowski:1977sc}.
Low-scale solutions are also possible by taking the Yukawa couplings to be similar %
or smaller than the other SM lepton Yukawa couplings.
For example if $m_D$ takes values in the keV range, new nearly-sterile states would exist with masses around a GeV.
%
 The resulting mixing is constrained by the contribution given to light neutrino masses and naively one can expect to have
%
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:TypeI_mixing_bound}
	\qty|U_{\alpha N}|^2 \lesssim \frac{m_\nu}{m_N} \lesssim  \np{e-10}\ \frac{1\,\mathrm{GeV}}{m_N}\ ,
	%
\end{equation}
%
where $m_\nu\lesssim 0.1$\,eV is assumed.
Specific models in which low energy neutrino masses and mixing angles are derived from the seesaw parameters %
allow for a broader range of values, invoking specific structures for the Yukawa couplings.
For example, it has been pointed out that in some cases a lower bound on different combinations of %
$|U_{ \alpha N}|^2$ can be found, depending on the number and mass hierarchy of heavy neutrinos %
and the value of the lightest neutrino masses (see \refref{Gorbunov:2013dta,Drewes:2019mhg}).
Values larger than the ones expected from \refeq{eq:TypeI_mixing_bound} can be obtained %
by advocating specific cancellations in the heavy neutrino contribution to light neutrino masses.
For instance, in analogy to \refref{Moffat:2018wke}, one can use the Casas-Ibarra parametrisation~\cite{Casas:2001sr}
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:CasasIbarra}
	m_D \simeq i \ U \ m_\text{diag}^{1/2}\ R\ M_R^{-1/2}\ ,
\end{equation}
where $U$ is the usual $3\times 3$ PMNS mixing matrix %
which diagonalises $m_\nu$ into the diagonal matrix containing the three light neutrinos $m_\text{diag}$.
$R$ is an arbitrary complex orthogonal matrix, the entries of which are not bounded and could be much larger than one.
Consequently, the mixing angles between the active and heavy sterile neutrinos, %
which scale as $m_D\, M_{R}^{-1}$, can be enhanced without violating the bound from neutrino masses, %
in which $R$ does not enter.
Differently from \refref{Moffat:2018wke}, one loop corrections are negligible at the GeV scale and do not introduce additional fine-tuning. 

Without advocating specific forms of the Yukawa coupling, %
the bound in Eq.~(\ref{eq:TypeI_mixing_bound}) can be avoided in presence of more than three sterile neutrinos %
thanks to the cancellation between their contributions to neutrino masses.
In recent years, a lot of interest has focused on these type of models, like for example %
the Inverse Seesaw~(ISS)~\cite{Mohapatra:1986bd, GonzalezGarcia:1988rw}, extended seesaw~\cite{Barr:2003nn}, %
and linear seesaw models~\cite{Malinsky:2005bi,Kang:2006sn}.
The focus of this thesis is on the ISS model.

\section{Heavy neutrino decay}
\label{sec:decay}


%We compute the heavy neutrino decay rates and polarised distributions necessary for studies in experimental searches.
%We compute rates for both Majorana and (pseudo-)Dirac states, allowing us to consistently explore the parameter space of low-scale seesaw models.
%
%%
%In this section we discuss the decay rates of Majorana and (pseudo-)Dirac 
%sterile neutrinos for their most promising signatures, taking particular care
%over the polarization of the beam discussed in the previous section.

%%%% THIS SHOULD GO SOMEHWERE
%If the new neutrinos are massive enough, their mass-splittings with the light neutrinos %
%could be larger than the wave packet energy-uncertainty associated with the production mechanism and they no longer %
%oscillate~(see \eg\ \refref{Akhmedov:2009rb}).
%Instead, the neutrinos are stable enough to propagate to a short-baseline detector and decay into visible SM particles.
%%%


The heavy neutrino decay rates and polarised distributions necessary for studies in experimental searches are presented in this section.
The calculations can be simplified by noting the following equivalences.
A Majorana neutrino $N$ decaying via a charged current process has the same differential %
decay rate as the Dirac neutrino $N_D$ with the appropriate lepton number, 
\begin{align}
	\dd{\Gamma}(N\to \ell_\alpha^- X^+) = \dd{\Gamma}(N_D\to \ell_\alpha^- X^+)\ , \\
	\dd{\Gamma}(N\to \ell_\alpha^+ X^-) = \dd{\Gamma}(\cj{N}_D\to \ell_\alpha^+ X^-)\ ,
\end{align}
where identical mass and mixing angles for both Dirac and Majorana neutrinos are taken. 
This equivalence can be seen directly from the Feynman rules for Dirac and Majorana fermions~\cite{Denner:1992me,Abada:2016plb}, %
but also explicitly in the formulae below.
In a neutral current (NC) decay, however, the two contractions of the NC operator lead to another contribution, %
and so
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:gamma_NC_sum}
	\dd{\Gamma}(N \to \nu X') = \dd{\Gamma}(N_D\to \nu X') + \dd{\Gamma}(\cj{N}_D\to\cj{\nu} X')\ .
\end{equation}
These relations hold at the differential level if the kinematic variables are reinterpreted in the obvious way.
In this sense, the Majorana process can be seen as the sum of Dirac particle and antiparticle decays.
It is important to observe that in a general amplitude with Majorana states, there would also be an interference %
contribution between these two subprocesses.
However, in all cases of interest, interference diagrams are proportional to the final-state light neutrino mass, %
which for the sake of simplicity is zero.
%
%If we consider the total decay rates only, we can make a further
%simplification if $Y$ is its own CP conjugate, $Y=\overline{Y}$. As CP
%violation requires the interference of strong and weak phases \cite{}, at
%tree-level these processes are identical $\Gamma(\overline{\nu}\to
%\overline{\nu} Y) = \Gamma(\overline{\nu}\to \overline{\nu} \overline{Y}) =
%\Gamma(\nu \to \nu Y)$.
%
Considering the total decay rates only, the Majorana decay is larger by a factor of 2 compared to the Dirac case,
\begin{equation}
	\Gamma(N\to \nu X' ) = 2\Gamma(N_D \to \nu X')\ .
\end{equation}
This is, however, only true for the total decay rates with massless final-state neutrinos.

It is instructive to reconsider this result in the light of the %
\emph{practical Dirac--Majorana confusion theorem}~\cite{Kayser:1981nw, Kayser:1982br}.
In \refref{Kayser:1981nw}, the decomposition into particle and antiparticle processes was performed for %
the Majorana neutrino--electron scattering via neutral current, which led to a factor of two enhancement in the total rate.
However, this enhancement was shown to be absent in practice due to the polarisation of the incoming neutrino %
which suppresses the $\Delta L = 2$ contributions by factors of the neutrino mass. 
In the present case of nearly-sterile decay, where mass effects are large and essential to the calculation, %
there is no analogous effect: Dirac and Majorana neutrinos will have distinct total decay rates regardless of their polarisation. 
Hence, the total decay rates of heavy neutrinos into observable final states could in principle allow to determine %
the Majorana/Dirac nature of the initial state.
This is not a trivial effect; for example, a pure Majorana state decays with equal probability into $e^-\pi^+$ as $e^+ \pi^-$, %
one of its dominant and most experimentally distinctive decay modes, while a Dirac heavy neutrino %
will only decay into $e^-\pi^+$.
%
Assuming charge-identification is possible in the detector, distinguishing between the two total decay rates %
should be possible with modest statistics. %
%\footnote{Even if charged-ID is not available, some distributional distinctions can be made in principle, as we discuss later.}
In a charge-blind search or for an NC channel, the total decay rate of Majorana neutrinos would appear %
to be twice as large as that of Dirac neutrinos.
However, since the mixing is usually an unknown quantity, the difference between %
Majorana and Dirac nature in this scenario cannot be deduced as easily.
There is also a more subtle impact of the nature of the decaying neutrino.
Even though the total decay rate is not affected by the helicity of the initial neutrino, %
the helicity plays an important role on the distributions of final-state particles, %
which will in turn influence the observability of the signatures of neutrino decay. 
Although spin-averaged Majorana neutrino decay rates are well known in the %
literature~\cite{Atre:2009rg,Gorbunov:2007ak,Helo:2010cw,Bondarenko:2018ptm}, %
it is important that these polarisation effects are correctly implemented when studying the distributions of %
final-state observables and subsequently when developing an analysis to tackle backgrounds.

In calculating the decay rates, summing over any possible outgoing states as
\begin{equation}
	\Gamma(N\to \nu X') \equiv \sum_{i=1}^3 \Gamma(N\to\nu_i X')
\end{equation}
defines a semi-inclusive decay rate into the visible particle(s) $X'$, such that %
discussions about the nature and flavours of final-state neutrinos can be avoided.
Many other authors treat light neutrinos as Dirac particles, %
and construct the full decay width using arguments of CP invariance, %
in practice amounting to adding some judicious factors of two~\cite{Atre:2009rg,Bondarenko:2018ptm}.
Following this approach, the summed decay rate for $N\to\nu X'$ can be seen as 
\begin{equation}
	\Gamma(N\to \nu X') \equiv \sum_{\alpha=e}^\tau \qty[\Gamma(N\to\nu_\alpha X') + %
	\Gamma(N\to\overline{\nu}_\alpha X')]\ .
\end{equation}
The two approaches are identical mathematical procedures and can both be used to compute the differential decay rates; %
however, the light neutrinos in most seesaw models are Majorana fermions and making a distinction %
between $\nu_\alpha$ and $\overline{\nu}_\alpha$ is physically misleading.
The approach could be seen as a short-hand for decay rates into polarised massless neutrinos, %
but this only adds a further complication when dealing with polarisation effects in the beam.
The distribution of events, the role of helicity and the heavy neutrino nature are found to be obscured by this approach.
In contrast, by summing over all outgoing states, the following formulae are insensitive to the Majorana/Dirac nature of the light neutrinos, %
and so are the physically relevant rates necessary for comparison with experimental searches since outgoing neutrinos are not reconstructed.

In the remainder of this section, the polarised heavy neutrino decay rates and distributions %
for Majorana and (pseudo-)Dirac neutrinos are presented.
All the decay modes considered are listed in~\reftab{tab:decays} and their respective branching ratios %
are shown in~\reffig{fig:branch} as functions of the neutrino mass.
The differential widths have been computed using the massive spinor-helicity formalism~\cite{Dittmaier:1998nn, Diaz-Cruz:2016ahc} %

\subsection{Majorana neutrinos}
\label{sec:decay_majorana}

\subsubsection{Pseudoscalar mesons}
\label{sec:decay_pseudoscalar}


The semileptonic meson decays are some of the most important channels identified in previous %
studies~\cite{Atre:2009rg, Ballett:2016opr, Asaka:2012bb} %
thanks to their large branching ratios and distinctive signature of two charged particles with a common vertex.
Both charged and neutral pseudoscalar mesons are viable final-state particles, namely $P^\pm$ and $P^0$, %
and the decay widths are given in the centre of mass (CM) frame by
\begin{align}
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^- P^+) &= %
	|U_{\alpha N}|^2|V_{q\, \cj{q}}|^2  \frac{G_\text{F}^2f_P^2 m_N^3}{16\pi} %
	\ I^\pm_1 \qty(\xi^2_\alpha, \xi^2_P; \theta_\alpha)\ ,\label{eq:M_decay_pseudo_plus}\\
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^+ P^-) &= %
	|U_{\alpha N}|^2|V_{q\, \cj{q}}|^2  \frac{G_\text{F}^2f_P^2m_N^3}{16\pi} %
	\ I^\mp_1 \qty(\xi^2_\alpha, \xi^2_P; \theta_\alpha)\ ,\label{eq:M_decay_pseudo_minus}\\
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_P} \qty(N \to \nu P^0)\hphantom{{}^-} &= %
	\qty(\sum_{\alpha=e}^\tau| U_{\alpha N}|^2) \frac{G_\text{F}^2f_{P^0}^2m_N^3}{16\pi} %
	\ \frac{I_1 \qty(0, \xi^2_P)}{4\pi}\ ,\label{eq:M_decay_pseudo_0}
\end{align}
where $\Gamma_h$ is the decay rate for neutrinos of helicity $h$, %
$V_{q \cj{q}}$ is the appropriate CKM matrix element for the considered meson, $f_P$ is its decay constant, %
and $\xi_i = m_i/m_N$ denotes the mass of the final-state particle $i$ as a fraction of the initial-state mass. 
The solid angle elements $\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}$ and $\Omega_P$ refer respectively to the charged lepton and %
pseudoscalar meson angles with respect to the neutrino direction.
The kinematic function
\begin{equation}
	I^\pm_1 (x, y; \theta) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\kallen(1, x, y) \qty[(1-x)^2 - y\,(1+x) \pm (x-1)\kallen(1, x, y) \cos\theta]
\end{equation}
is a generalisation of the function
\begin{equation}
	I_1 (x, y) = \kallen(1, x, y)\, \qty[(1-x)^2 - y(1+x)]\ ,
\end{equation}
introduced in~\refref{Atre:2009rg}, where $x$ and $y$ are squared mass ratios.
After integrating over the angular variables, it is found that %
both the pseudoscalar meson decay rates do not depend on the helicity, as expected:
%
%	\begin{align*}
%		\Gamma_\pm \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^- P^+) &= %
%		\frac{G_F^2}{16\pi} f_P^2\, |V_{q\, \cj{q}}|^2\, |U_{\alpha 4}|^2 m_N^3\,\lambda^\frac{1}{2}(1, \xi_\alpha, \xi_P) %
%		\qty[(1-\xi_\alpha)^2 - \xi_P(1+\xi_\alpha)]\ ,\\
%		\Gamma_\pm \qty(N \to \nu_\alpha P^0) &= 
%		\frac{G_F^2}{16\pi} f_P^2\, |U_{\alpha 4}|^2 m_N^3\, \qty(1-\xi_P^2)^2\ .
%	\end{align*}
%
\begin{align}
	\Gamma_\pm \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^- P^+) &= \Gamma_\pm \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^+ P^-) = %
	|V_{q\, \cj{q}}|^2 |U_{\alpha N}|^2 \frac{G_F^2f_P^2m_N^3}{16\pi}\ I_1\qty(\xi^2_\alpha, \xi^2_P)\ ,\\
	\Gamma_\pm \qty(N \to \nu P^0)\hphantom{{}^-} &= \left(\sum_{\alpha=e}^\tau|U_{\alpha N}|^2\right) %
	\frac{G_F^2f_P^2m_N^3}{16\pi}\ I_1\qty(0,\xi^2_P)\ .
\end{align}
%
These rates agree with those presented in \refrefs{Bondarenko:2018ptm,Gorbunov:2007ak}, %
correcting a factor of two discrepancy in the $\nu P^0$ rate of \refrefs{Atre:2009rg,Helo:2010cw}.
The Feynman diagram for the charged and neutral pseudoscalar meson channels are shown in \ref{fig:HNL_fyenman_two}.

\end{figure}

The decay into a neutral meson is isotropic in the rest frame as seen in \refeq{eq:M_decay_pseudo_0}, %
while the charged-pion modes in \refeqs{eq:M_decay_pseudo_plus}{eq:M_decay_pseudo_minus} inherit %
their angular dependence from $I^\pm(x, y; \theta_\alpha)$, %
where $\theta_\alpha$ is the lepton angle to the beam line in the heavy neutrino rest frame.
The isotropy of the neutral current decay $N\to\nu P^0$ is a manifestation of %
the Majorana nature of the particle, in agreement with the discussion of \refref{Balantekin:2018ukw}.
It is worth noting that if final states are not charge-identified, a similar isotropy %
is obtained for the total rate of charged semileptonic decays, 
%
\begin{align}  
	%
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha P) &\equiv
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^+ P^-) +
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^- P^+) \notag \\
	%
	&= |U_{\alpha N}|^2|V_{q\, \cj{q}}|^2  \frac{G_\text{F}^2f_P^2m_N^3}{16\pi}
	\ \frac{I_1 \qty(\xi^2_\alpha, \xi^2_P)}{2\pi}\ . 
	%
\end{align}
%

The formulae above apply for all pseudoscalar mesons which are kinematically allowed.
For instance, below the $K^0$ mass, the heavy neutrino can decay only into pions, %
but above this limit $\eta$ and $\eta'$ are also allowed in the final state.
%but for heavier masses 
%However, for steriles produced by $D_s$ meson decay, a charged kaon in the final state is also possible.
%For masses towards the upper limit of our range, decays into $\tau$ final states are also possible, %
%\eg $N \to \tau^\mp \pi^\pm$, but the smaller phase space makes them negligible for the present work.
%The same conclusion is true for the mode $e^\mp D^\pm$.
%	
% The neutral pion is the only neutral pseudoscalar meson below the $K^0$ mass.
%Above this limit, the channels with an $\eta$ or an $\eta'$ in the final state become allowed.
%The majority of neutral pseudoscalar mesons decay electromagnetically into two photons or multi-pion final states. 

\subsubsection{Vector mesons}
\label{sec:decay_vector}

Although only for higher masses, HNL can also decay into vector mesons $V$, %
both via charged current, $N \to \ell^\mp V^\pm$, and neutral current, $N \to \nu V^0$.
The polarised differential distributions in the heavy neutrino rest frame are 
\begin{align}
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^- V^+) &= %
	|U_{\alpha N}|^2 |V_{q\, \cj{q}}|^2 \frac{G_\text{F}^2f_V^2 m_N^3}{16\pi} %
	\ I^\pm_2\qty(\xi^2_\alpha, \xi^2_V; \theta_\alpha)\ ,\label{eq:M_decay_vector_plus}\\
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^+ V^-) &= %
	|U_{\alpha N}|^2  |V_{q\, \cj{q}}|^2\frac{G_\text{F}^2f_V^2m_N^3}{16\pi} %
	\ I^\mp_2 \qty(\xi^2_\alpha, \xi^2_V; \theta_\alpha)\ ,\label{eq:M_decay_vector_minus}\\
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_V} \qty(N \to \nu V^0)\hphantom{{}^-} &= %
	\qty(\sum_{\alpha=e}^\tau| U_{\alpha N}|^2 ) %
	\frac{G_\text{F}^2f_{V}^2\kappa_V^2m_N^3}{16\pi}\ \frac{I_2 \qty(0, \xi^2_V)}{4\pi}\label{eq:M_decay_vector_0}\ ,
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
	I^\pm_2 (x, y;\theta) = \frac{1}{4\pi}\kallen(1, x, y) \Big[&(1+x-y)\,(1+x+2y)-4x \notag \\ %
								&\pm (x+2y-1)\kallen(1, x, y) \cos\theta\Big]
\end{align}
and
\begin{equation}
	I_2 (x, y) = \kallen(1, x, y)\, \qty[(1+x-y)(1+x+2y)-4x]\ ,
\end{equation}
also presented in~\refref{Atre:2009rg}.
The total decay widths are given by
\begin{align}
	\Gamma\qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^- V^+) &=  \Gamma\qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^+ V^-) = %
	|U_{\alpha N}|^2 |V_{q\,\cj{q}}|^2 \frac{G_F^2 f_V^2m_N^3}{16\pi}\ I_2\qty(\xi^2_\alpha,\xi^2_V)\ ,\\
	\Gamma\qty(N \to \nu V^0)\hphantom{{}^-} &= \left(\sum_{\alpha = e}^\tau |U_{\alpha N}|^2\right) %
	\frac{G_F^2f_V^2\kappa_V^2  m_N^3}{16\pi}\ I_2\qty(0,\xi^2_V)\ ,
\end{align}
where the constants $\kappa_V$ are the following combinations of the Weinberg angle, which depend on the flavour structure of $V^0$:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:kappa_factors}
	\kappa_\rho   = 1-\sin^2\theta_W \quad,\quad
	\kappa_\omega = \frac{4}{3} \sin^2\theta_W \quad,\quad
	\kappa_\phi   = \frac{4}{3} \sin^2\theta_W -1\ .
\end{equation}
The charged pseudovector decay rates agree with \refrefs{Bondarenko:2018ptm, Atre:2009rg, Helo:2010cw, Gorbunov:2007ak} %
while the neutral pseudoscalar calculation agrees with the corrected version presented in \refref{Bondarenko:2018ptm}.
The Feynman diagram for these two processes are equivalent to the pseudoscalar meson ones, shown in \ref{fig:HNL_fyenman_two}.

As with the pseudoscalar meson decay rates, the Majorana nature leads to an isotropic decay into a neutral vector meson.
An analogous effect holds for the charged vector meson decay if the charges of final-state particles %
are not distinguished.
In this case, the physically relevant decay distribution in the particle rest frame is given by
\begin{align}
	%
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha V) &\equiv \dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} %
	\qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^- V^+) + \dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^+ V^-)\ , \notag\\
	%
	&= |U_{\alpha N}|^2 \frac{G_\text{F}^2f_V^2}{16\pi} |V_{q\, \cj{q}}|^2\, m_N^3 %
	\ \frac{I_2 \qty(\xi^2_\alpha, \xi^2_V)}{2\pi}\ .
	%
\end{align}
There are no vector mesons lighter than the $K^0$, and these decays become relevant only for higher masses %
for which decays into $\rho^\pm$ and $K^{*\pm}$, and for the neutral mode into $\rho^0$, $\omega$, and $\phi$ would be relevant.
%Vector mesons usually into a multi-state of pseudoscalar mesons, depending on the initial flavour content,
%sometimes accompanied by photon emission making their reconstruction challenging from an experimental point of view.

%The differential decay rates for these modes are more complicated to write
%down, but we give compact formulae for these channels in
%App.~\ref{app:threebody_dist}. 
%

Let us assign the momenta to the particles in the three-body decay as follows
\begin{equation}
	N(k_1) \to \nu(k_2)\, \ell_\alpha^-(k_3)\,\ell^+_\beta(k_4)\ ,
\end{equation}
and denote $k_i^2 = m_i^2$.
The five-dimensional phase space of the final-state particles can be parameterised using the two scaled invariant masses
\begin{equation}
	s_1=\frac{(k_2+k_3)^2}{m_N^2} \qquad \text{and} \qquad s_2=\frac{(k_2+k_4)^2}{m_N^2}\ ,
\end{equation}
as well as the three lab-frame angular variables, $(\theta_3, \varphi_3)$ giving the direction of $\ell^-_\alpha$ %
and $\varphi_{43}$ denoting the relative azimuthal angle between $\ell^-_\alpha$ and $\ell^+_\beta$. 
Although $\cos\theta_4$ is not an independent element of this parametrisation, it is a physically relevant quantity %
which is used to simplify the presentation of the distributions below.
It can be easily related to the fundamental variables $s_1,s_2,\theta_3,\varphi_3, \varphi_{43}$ %
as 
\begin{equation}
	\cos \theta_4 = \cos \theta_3 \cos \theta_{43} - \sin\theta_3 \sin\theta_{43}\cos\varphi_{43}\ ,
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
	\cos \theta_{43} = \frac{s_1 + s_2 - m_N^2 + 2\, E_3\, E_4}{ \abs{p_3} \abs{p_4}}\ .
\end{equation}
The differential decay rate is expressed as
\begin{equation}  
	\label{eq:threebody_dist_master}
	\dd{\Gamma_\pm} = \frac{G_F^2 m_N^5}{16 \pi^3} \qty(|A_0|^2\pm|A_1|^2) %
	\dd{s_1} \dd{s_2}\, \frac{\dd{\Omega_3}}{4\pi}\ \frac{\dd{\varphi_{43}}}{2\pi}\ ,
\end{equation}
where $\Omega_3$ assumes the conventional meaning and 
\begin{align}
	%
	|A_0|^2 &\equiv C_1 \qty(s_2-\xi^2_3) \qty(1+\xi^2_4-s_2) + C_2 \qty(s_1-\xi^2_4) \qty(1+\xi^2_3-s_1) \notag \\
	\label{eq:threebody_1}
	&\qquad + 2\,C_3\,\xi_3\,\xi_4 \qty(s_1+s_2 - \xi^2_3 - \xi^2_4)\ , \\
	%
	|A_1|^2 &\equiv \qty[ C_4 \qty(s_2-\xi_3^2) - 2\,C_6\,\xi_3\,\xi_4]\kallen(1,s_2,\xi_4^2)\cos\theta_4 \notag \\
	\label{eq:threebody_2}
	&\qquad + \qty[C_5 \qty(s_1-\xi_4^2) - 2\,C_6\,\xi_3\,\xi_4]\kallen(1,s_1,\xi_3^2)\cos\theta_3\ .   
	%
\end{align}
%
%with $\Gamma_h$ denoting the decay rate of a heavy neutrino with
%helicity $h$. 
The coefficients $C_i$ are polynomials in chiral couplings and extended PMNS matrix elements, %
and they read
\begin{align}
	C_1 &= \sum_{\gamma =e}^\tau |U_{\gamma i}|^2 \qty[ (g_L^2+g_R^2)\delta_{\alpha\beta} + %
	\delta_{\gamma\alpha}(1+\delta_{\alpha\beta}g_L)]\ ,\notag \\
	%
	C_2 &= \sum_{\gamma =e}^\tau |U_{\gamma i}|^2 \qty[ (g_L^2+g_R^2)\delta_{\alpha\beta} + %
	\delta_{\gamma\beta}(1+\delta_{\alpha\beta}g_L)]\ ,\notag \\
	%
	C_3 &= 2\delta_{\alpha\beta}\,g_R\sum_{\gamma = e}^\tau |U_{\gamma i}|^2(\delta_{\alpha\gamma} + g_L)\ ,\notag \\
	%
	C_4 &= \sum_{\gamma =e}^\tau |U_{\gamma i}|^2 \qty[ \delta_{\alpha\beta}(g_L^2-g_R^2) + %
	\delta_{\gamma\alpha}(1+\delta_{\alpha\beta}g_L)]\ ,\notag \\
	%
	C_5 &= -\sum_{\gamma =e}^\tau |U_{\gamma i}|^2 \qty[ \delta_{\alpha\beta}(g_L^2-g_R^2) + %
	\delta_{\gamma\beta}(1+\delta_{\alpha\beta}g_L)]\ ,\notag \\
	%
	\label{eq:lepton_coefficient}
	C_6 &= 0\ .
\end{align}
On integration over the angular coordinates, however, only the $|A_0|^2$ term survives %
and the standard expression for the total decay rates is recovered through the following identities
\begin{align}   
	\int\!\! \dd{s_1}\!\! \int\!\! \dd{s_2}\, (s_2-\xi^2_3)(1+\xi^2_4-s_2) &= \frac{I_1(0,\xi^2_3,\xi_4^2)}{12}\ ,\\ 
	%
	\int\!\! \dd{s_1}\!\! \int\!\! \dd{s_2}\, (s_1-\xi^2_4)(1+\xi^2_3-s_1) &= \frac{I_1(0,\xi^2_4,\xi_3^2)}{12}\ ,\\ 
	%\
	\int\!\! \dd{s_1}\!\! \int\!\! \dd{s_2}\ 2\xi_3\,\xi_4(s_1+s_2-\xi^2_3-\xi^2_3) &= %
	\frac{I_2(0,\xi^2_3,\xi_4^2)}{12}\ .
\end{align}
The functions $I_1\qty(x,y,z)$ and $I_2\qty(x,y,z)$ are kinematic functions derived by %
integrating over the phase space
\begin{align}
	I_1(x,y,z) &= 12 \int\limits_{\qty(\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{y})^2}^{\qty(1-\sqrt{z})^2}\!\! %
	\frac{\dd{s}}{s} (s-x-y)\,(1+z-s)\kallen(1,x,y)\kallen(1,s,z)\ ,\\
	%
	I_2(x,y,z)&=24\,\sqrt{yz} \int\limits_{\qty(\sqrt{y}+\sqrt{z})^2}^{\qty(1-\sqrt{x})^2}\!\! %
	\frac{\dd{s}}{s}(1+x-s)\kallen(s,y,z)\kallen(1,s,x)\ .
\end{align}
Thus, the general expression for the total decay rate is again helicity independent and can be written as
\begin{align}
	\Gamma_\pm(N \to \nu \ell_\alpha^- \ell_\beta^+) = %
	\frac{G_F^2 m_N^5}{192 \pi^3}\,\Big[ &C_1\ I_1\qty(0,\xi_3^2,\xi_4^2) + %
	C_2\ I_1\qty(0,\xi_4^2,\xi_3^2) \notag \\ %
	&+ C_3\ I_2\qty(0,\xi_3^2,\xi_4^2) \Big]\ .
\end{align}
Using the expressions for $C_i$ of \refeq{eq:lepton_coefficient} the total decay rates are given %
to first order in the heavy--active mixing parameters $U_{\alpha N}$ by
\begin{align}
	%
	&\Gamma_\pm\qty(N \to \nu \ell_\alpha^- \ell_\beta^+) = 
	\frac{G_F^2m_N^5}{192\pi^3}\ \qty[ |U_{\alpha N}|^2\ I_1 \qty(0, \xi_\alpha^2, \xi_\beta^2) + %
	|U_{\beta N}|^2\ I_1\qty(0, \xi_\beta^2, \xi_\alpha^2)]\ ,\\
	%
	&\Gamma_\pm\qty(N \to \nu \ell_\alpha^- \ell_\alpha^+) = %
	\frac{G_F^2 m_N^5}{96\pi^3} \sum_{\gamma=e}^\tau |U_{\gamma N}|^2 %
	\Big\{\qty(g_L g_R + \delta_{\gamma \alpha} g_R)\  I_2 \qty(0, \xi_\alpha^2, \xi_\alpha^2)  \notag \\
	&\hspace{15em}+ \qty[g_L^2 + g_R^2 + \delta_{\gamma \alpha} (1+2g_L)]%
	\ I_1 \qty(0, \xi_\alpha^2, \xi_\alpha^2)\Big\}\ . 
\end{align}	
where $\alpha \neq \beta$, $g_L = -1/2 + \sin^2\theta_\text{W}$ and $g_R =\sin^2\theta_\text{W}$.
The total decay rates agree with those in \refrefs{Bondarenko:2018ptm, Atre:2009rg, Helo:2010cw, Gorbunov:2007ak} %
and correct a typographical mistake in the rates presented in \refref{Ballett:2016opr}. 
The CC and NC diagrams for these three-body leptonic decays are shown in \ref{fig:HNL_fyenman_three}, %
bearing in mind that $\alpha = \beta$ is allowed and the inevitable interference terms must be considered. 

All possible combinations of charged leptons except $\nu \tau^- \tau^+$ are allowed for masses below~$m_{D_s}$.
However, the decays into $\nu \tau^\mp e^\pm$ and $\nu \tau^\mp \mu^\pm$ can be neglected due to the limited phase space.
The number of events from these modes is negligible with respect to other channels. 

\subsubsection{Other decays}
\label{sec:decay_other}

There are some other decay rates relevant to this study but not as viable observable channels.
First, the total decay width of the process $N \to \nu \bar{\nu} \nu$, mediated by the $Z$ boson, reads %
%
\begin{equation}
	\Gamma\qty(N \to \nu \bar{\nu} \nu) = \left(\sum_{\gamma = e}^\tau|U_{\gamma 4}|^2\right) \frac{G_F^2m_N^5}{96\pi^3}\ .
\end{equation}
%
Although this decay mode is experimentally invisible, it is the dominant channel up to the pion mass, %
when two-body semileptonic decays open up, and plays a significant role in defining the branching ratios of the observable channels.
The expression agrees with \refrefs{Bondarenko:2018ptm,Atre:2009rg,Helo:2010cw,Gorbunov:2007ak} %
once the correct adjustments for Majorana and Dirac light neutrinos are applied.
%
Secondly, there are other decay modes with small branching ratios and/or complicated final states which are not studied here.
These include the one-loop decay into a photon which has received some interest as an observable signature %
in nonminimal models~\cite{Gninenko:2009ks,Gninenko:2010pr,Magill:2018jla} where it may be enhanced. %
In the mass models considered in this work, it has a branching ratio of below $10^{-3}$ and will not be considered. 
Other interesting but neglected channels are the multi-pion decay modes discussed in \refref{Bondarenko:2018ptm}, %
which are estimated to have at most a percent level branching ratio and a challenging hadronic final state for reconstruction. 
%
%   The total decay width in the minimal model considered here is
%
%  	\begin{equation}
% 		\Gamma\qty(N \to \nu \gamma) = \frac{27\alpha_\text{EM}}{32\pi} \sum_\alpha %\frac{G_F^2}{192\pi^3} |U_{\alpha 4}|^2 m_N^5\ .
%	\end{equation}
%



\subsection{Pseudo-Dirac neutrinos}
\label{sec:decay_dirac}

Pseudo-Dirac particles or antiparticles are coherent superpositions of paired Majorana mass eigenstates, 
\begin{equation}
	N_\text{P} = U_{s i}\, \nu_i + i\,U_{s j}\, \nu_j \qquad\text{and}\qquad %
	\cj{N}_\text{P} = U^*_{s i}\,\nu_i + i\,U^*_{s j}\,\nu_j\ ,
\end{equation}
where $U_{s k}$ is the mixing between mass states and sterile flavour states.
Thanks to this decomposition, the decay rate calculation can be recovered from the treatment of a pure Majorana state %
by summing coherently over the constituent Majorana contributions.
In a true Dirac pair, the two components have identical masses and PMNS matrix elements %
which obey $U_{\alpha i} = \pm i\, U_{\alpha j}$.
On coherent summation, this leads to perfect cancellation in any LNV process.
For pseudo-Dirac particles, the constituent states have both a mass difference and mixing angles %
usually proportional to the LNV parameters introduced in \refeq{eq:lagrangian_LNV}, %
therefore of slightly different magnitudes.
This leads to an imperfect cancellation in LNV modes.
%Expanding in the mass splitting $\Delta m = m_4-m_5$ and difference in PMNS matrix elements %
%$|\Delta U|^2 \equiv U_{\alpha 4}^2 + U_{\alpha 5}^2 = |U_{\alpha 4}|^2 - |U_{\alpha 5}|^2$ ,
%the leading order decay rates of a pseudo-Dirac state $N_\text{P}$ into a charged pseudoscalar is:
%
%\begin{align}
%	\Gamma_\pm \qty(N_P \to \ell_\alpha^- P^+) &= %
%	|U|^2 |V_{q\, \cj{q}}|^2  \frac{G_\text{F}^2f_P^2 m_N^3}{16\pi} I^\pm_1 (\xi^2_\alpha, \xi^2_P)\ ,\\
%	\Gamma_\pm \qty(N_P \to \ell_\alpha^+ P^-) &= %
%	|V_{q\, \cj{q}}|^2  \frac{G_\text{F}^2f_P^2m_N^3}{16\pi} \bigg[|\Delta U|^2I^\mp_1 (\xi^2_\alpha, \xi^2_P)\ + \\
%	&\hphantom{|V_{q\, \cj{q}}|^2  \frac{G_\text{F}^2f_P^2m_N^3}{16\pi}} %
%	\qquad \frac{\Delta m}{2m_N}|U|^2(1-\xi^2_\alpha)(3+\xi^2_\alpha - \xi^2_P)\bigg]\ . \notag
%\end{align}
%
%where $|U|^2 \equiv |U_{\alpha 4}|^2+|U_{\alpha 5}|^2$ is the equivalent mixing
%angle expected for a pure Dirac state.
%
In spite of this, LNV decays are still allowed for pseudo-Dirac particles, but subdominant compared to pure Majorana states.
The contributions to these negligible rates are suppressed by either the mass %
splitting or the difference in mixing angles, both of which are governed by the %
small LNV parameter in low-scale seesaw models.
Although present, it seems unlikely that such channels would be of experimental relevance in %
the near future as they are always accompanied by dominant decay modes with oppositely-charged final states.
The signatures of these particles is actually regulated by the leading order LNC effects and %
as such a strict Dirac limit is taken into the calculations of the decay rates for \mbox{(pseudo-)Dirac} pairs.
However, if evidence for a sterile neutrino is found and significant statistics are collected, %
the search for LNV channels could in principle provide evidence of the Majorana or pseudo-Dirac nature of the HNL.
Moreover, it would allow the measurement of the LNV parameter behind the model, %
which should correlate with the scale of light-neutrino masses %
and so provide an important test of the relationship between the novel particle and neutrino mass generation models.

The decay rates for a Dirac heavy (anti)neutrino are similar in form to those presented for the Majorana neutrino.
The key differences are lepton number conservation, which acts to forbid certain channels, and differences in %
the angular distributions of the neutral current decays.
For charged current--mediated processes, the distributions for Dirac neutrinos and antineutrinos %
are mathematically identical to the distributions for Majorana neutrinos.
The two-body semileptonic decays are the same of \refeqs{eq:M_decay_pseudo_plus}{eq:M_decay_vector_plus},
\begin{align}
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(N_D \to \ell_\alpha^- P^+) &= %
	\dv{\Gamma_\mp}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(\cj{N}_D \to \ell_\alpha^+ P^-) = % 
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^- P^+) \ ,   \\
	%	|U_{\alpha N}|^2|V_{q\, \cj{q}}|^2  \frac{G_\text{F}^2f_P^2 m_N^3}{16\pi} %
	%	\ I^\pm_1 \qty(\xi_\alpha^2, \xi_P^2; \theta_\alpha)\ ,\\
	%
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(N_D \to \ell_\alpha^- V^+) &= %
	\dv{\Gamma_\mp}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(\cj{N}_D \to \ell_\alpha^+ V^-)  = %
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_{\ell_\alpha}} \qty(N \to \ell_\alpha^- V^+)\ .
	%|U_{\alpha N}|^2  |V_{q\, \cj{q}}|^2\frac{G_\text{F}^2f_V^2m_N^3}{16\pi} %:
	%\ I^\pm_2 \qty(\xi_\alpha^2, \xi_V^2; \theta_\alpha)\ ,\\
	%
\end{align}
The situation for NC processes is different with respect to Majorana neutrinos.
The distribution of the final-state particles is not isotropic anymore and it depends on the helicity state of the initial neutrino, %
in the way shown by the following differential rates
%
%	\begin{align*}
%		\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_\alpha} \qty(N_D \to \ell_\alpha^- P^+) &= %
%	|U_{\alpha 4}|^2|V_{q\, \cj{q}}|^2  \frac{G_\text{F}^2f_P^2 m_N^3}{16\pi} I^\pm_1 (\xi_\alpha, \xi_P; \theta_\alpha),\\
%		\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_\alpha} \qty(N_D \to \ell_\alpha^- V^+) &= %
%	|U_{\alpha 4}|^2 \frac{G_\text{F}^2f_V^2}{16\pi} |V_{q\, \cj{q}}|^2\, m_N^3\, I^\pm_2 (\xi_\alpha, \xi_V; \theta_\alpha),\\
%		\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_P} \qty(N_D \to \nu P^0) &= %
%	 \left(\sum_{\alpha=e}^\tau| U_{\alpha 4}|^2\right)\frac{G_\text{F}^2f_{P^0}^2m_N^3}{32\pi} I_1^\pm (0, \xi_P; \theta_P),\\
%		\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_V} \qty(N_D \to \nu V^0) &= %
%	 \left(\sum_{\alpha=e}^\tau| U_{\alpha 4}|^2\right)\frac{G_\text{F}^2f_{V}^2\kappa_V^2m_N^3}{32\pi} I^\mp_2 (0, \xi_V;\theta_V).
%%
%\end{align*}
%%
%
\begin{align}
	%
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_P} \qty(N_D \to \nu P^0) &= %
	\dv{\Gamma_\mp}{\Omega_P} \qty(\cj{N}_D \to \cj{\nu} P^0) \notag \\ %
	&= \left(\sum_{\alpha=e}^\tau| U_{\alpha N}|^2\right)\frac{G_\text{F}^2f_{P^0}^2m_N^3}{32\pi} %
	\ I_1^\pm \qty(0, \xi_P^2; \theta_P)\ ,\\
	%  
	\dv{\Gamma_\pm}{\Omega_V} \qty(N_D \to \nu V^0) &= %
	\dv{\Gamma_\mp}{\Omega_V} \qty(\cj{N}_D \to \cj{\nu} V^0) \notag \\ %
	&= \left(\sum_{\alpha=e}^\tau| U_{\alpha N}|^2\right)\frac{G_\text{F}^2f_{V}^2\kappa_V^2m_N^3}{32\pi} %
	\ I^\mp_2 \qty(0, \xi_V^2;\theta_V)\ .
	%
\end{align}
%
The Feynman diagrams for these decay modes are the same of \ref{fig:HNL_fyenman_two}.

For three-body leptonic decays, the distribution is expressed in \refeq{eq:threebody_dist_master} %
with the relevant coefficients for a Dirac neutrino
\begin{align}
	C^\nu_1 &= C^\nu_4= \sum_{\gamma =e}^\tau |U_{\gamma i}|^2 \qty[\delta_{\alpha\beta} g_L^2+ %
	\delta_{\gamma\alpha}(1+\delta_{\alpha\beta}g_L)]\ ,\\ 
	%
	C^\nu_2 &= C^\nu_5= \delta_{\alpha\beta}\,g^2_R\sum_{\gamma = e}^\tau |U_{\gamma i}|^2\ ,\\ 
	%
	C^\nu_3 &= C^\nu_6= \delta_{\alpha\beta}\,g_R\sum_{\gamma = e}^\tau |U_{\gamma i}|^2(\delta_{\gamma\beta} + g_L)\ ,
\end{align}
and for a Dirac antineutrino
\begin{align}
	C^{\cj{\nu}}_1 &= -C^{\overline{\nu}}_4 = \delta_{\alpha\beta}\,g^2_R\sum_{\gamma = e}^\tau |U_{\gamma i}|^2\ ,\\
	%
	C^{\cj{\nu}}_2 &= -C^{\overline{\nu}}_5 = \sum_{\gamma =e}^\tau |U_{\gamma i}|^2 %
	\qty[ \delta_{\alpha\beta} g_L^2+ \delta_{\gamma\beta}(1+\delta_{\alpha\beta}g_L)]\ ,\\
	%
	C^{\cj{\nu}}_3 &= -C^{\overline{\nu}}_6 = \delta_{\alpha \beta}\, g_R\sum_{\gamma = e}^\tau |U_{\gamma i}|^2(\delta_{\alpha\gamma} + g_L)\ .
\end{align}
It is not surprising in view of \refeq{eq:gamma_NC_sum} to observe that these coefficients are related %
to the ones for the Majorana case as
\begin{equation}
	C_i  = C^\nu_i + C^{\cj{\nu}}_i\ .
\end{equation}
The total decay rates are found to be
\begin{align}
	%
	\Gamma_\pm\qty(N_D \to \nu \ell_\alpha^- \ell_\beta^+) &= |U_{\alpha N}|^2\frac{G_F^2m_N^5}{192\pi^3} %
	\ I_1 \qty(0, \xi_\alpha^2, \xi_\beta^2)\ ,\\

	% 
\end{align}	
where $\alpha \neq \beta$.
The resulting rates agree with those in \refrefs{Bondarenko:2018ptm, Atre:2009rg, Helo:2010cw, Gorbunov:2007ak}.

%%
%where $\alpha \neq \beta$, $g_L = -1/2 + \sin^2\theta_\text{W}$ and $g_R =\sin^2\theta_\text{W}$. Our total decay rates agree with those in \cite{Bondarenko:2018ptm, Atre:2009rg, Helo:2010cw, Gorbunov:2007ak}.  
%

All decay rates not listed above are forbidden for a Dirac (anti)particle as the combination of production %
and decay would amount to a LNV process.
% 
For the available modes, all NC modes are smaller by a factor of two for a Dirac (anti)neutrino compared %
to the equivalent Majorana process; however, the major difference between the Dirac (anti)neutrino and Majorana distributions %
is that these NC channels are dependent on the angular variables.
The differences in the distributions of the final-state particles could be exploited to identify %
the fermionic nature of the decaying HNL~\cite{Balantekin:2018ukw}.



\section{Heavy neutrino production}
\label{sec:production}


Heavy neutrinos can be produced in a beam dump experiment via the same processes %
that generate light neutrinos (see \refsec{sec:nu_acc}).
If kinematically allowed, heavy neutrino states can be sourced from two- and three-body decays of mesons and charged leptons.
All the neutrino production channels considered in this analysis are listed in \reftab{tab:branch}, %
where the heaviest neutrino mass $m_N$ that is accessible by kinematics is also reported.
%On the left, all the viable channels up to the $K^0$ mass are listed.
The possible parent particles producing neutrinos are, up to 2\,GeV in mass, %
pions, muons, charged and neutral kaons, strange charmed mesons $D_s$, and $\tau$ leptons.
As explained in \refsec{sec:nu_acc}, the production of mesons above the kaon mass requires very energetic proton beams %
which the majority of neutrino accelerator experiments do not posses.
For this reason, the HNL mass range considered goes from a few MeV up to almost 2\,GeV.
%{\color{green!70!black} I DO NOT THINK THIS GOES HERE. In fact the discussion above refers only to the case of light neutrinos as things are different for heavy ones. So I think we should just refer to the standard case in this paragraph, and then have the discussion of the heavy neutrinos in the two subsections below. .... The mass range considered spans therefore from a few keV up to $m_{D_s}-m_e$, if the heavy neutrino is %
%generated via non-zero electron mixing in the decay $D_s^+ \to e^+ N$. SO I CHANGED IT TO THE STATEMENT BELOW. IF YOU AGREE, PLEASE DELETE THIS ALL RED PARAGRAPH.}

The flux of heavy neutrinos produced is estimated starting from the flux of light neutrinos %
and scaling it by an energy-independent kinematic factor.
Given a certain SM neutrino production process, $Q \to \nu_\alpha Q'$, %
a scale factor is naively defined by the ratio between the decay width of the same process producing massive neutrinos, %
$Q \to N Q'$, and the rate of the SM decay with light neutrinos.
%The flux of light neutrinos $\nu_\alpha$ produced from the leptonic or semi-leptonic decay of a %
%given parent particle $P \to \nu_\alpha + X$ can be scaled to obtain an approximate heavy neutrino flux.
%Neglecting energy dependence, a simple scale factor is given by the ratio of the partial decay widths computed %
%in the model with an extra neutrino with respect to the width in the SM.
The full flux of nearly-sterile neutrinos with a given helicity is therefore a linear combination of the different neutrino flux components, %
$\phi_{Q \to\nu_\alpha}$, summing over all existing parents and all allowed flavours:
%
\begin{equation}
	\dv{\phi_N^\pm}{E} (E_N) \approx \sum_{Q, \alpha}  \mathcal{K}^{Q,\alpha}_\pm(m_N)\ \dv{\phi_{Q\to\nu_\alpha}}{E} (E_N - m_N)\ , %
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{K}^{Q,\alpha}_\pm(m_N) \equiv \frac{\Gamma_\pm(Q \to N Q')}{\Gamma(Q \to \nu_\alpha Q')}\ .
\end{equation}
%
The ratio $\mathcal{K}$ is proportional to the mixing parameter $|U_{\alpha N}|^2$ and contains only kinematic %
functions of the involved masses.
These are responsible for correcting phase space and helicity terms.
%{\color{blue} I changed X and Y to Q and Q' as we have used X and Y earlier to indicate the decay products of the heavy neutrinos.}

The helicity state plays a fundamental role in the production rate, in contrast with the case of neutrino decays, %
since there is no arbitrariness in the polarisation direction this time; %
this is defined by the neutrino momentum in the rest frame of the parent particle.
The massive spinor-helicity formalism is employed to compute the production decay rates for both Majorana and Dirac neutrinos, %
and these are used to build the scale factors for each neutrino helicity.
Even though lepton number is preserved differently in the two cases and different Feynman rules hold, %
all the production channels of interest in this work are mediated by charge current interactions %
and therefore the rates are mathematically identical for Majorana and Dirac neutrinos.
If the neutrino is Dirac, the production decay width for an antineutrino with given helicity is the same %
as the one of the neutrino, but with opposite helicity.
%If the neutrino is Majorana, talking about particle and antiparticle becomes meaningless and only helicity states exist.
The phenomenology of the scale factors is different for two- and three-body decays and so they are discussed, %
respectively, in~\refsec{sec:production_2body} and~\refsec{sec:production_3body}.
Only the four most probable decay modes of the $\tau$ lepton are considered in this analysis, %
as they provide a sufficient description of their contribution to the overall flux.
The decay $\tau^+ \to \cj{\nu}_\tau \pi^+ \pi^0$ is studied only at the level of %
phase space sampling in this~work.

\subsection{Two-body decays}
\label{sec:production_2body}

A massless neutrino (antineutrino) has its chiral and helicity states degenerate, and so %
it is always produced with a negative (positive) helicity.
It follows that the component of the light neutrino beam produced in two-body decays of pseudoscalar mesons is polarised.
The initial spin, which is zero, must be preserved in the decay, and since the helicity of the neutrino in the rest frame %
is fixed, the accompanying lepton is produced with a ``wrong'' helicity.
This is permitted by the nonzero mass of the charged lepton and %
%It follows that decay modes of pseudoscalar mesons with lighter leptons, e.g.\ $\pi^+\to \nu_e e^+$, are suppressed %
%and channels with heavier flavours, e.g.\ $\pi^+\to\nu_\mu \mu^+$, are favoured instead.
therefore final states with light flavour leptons undergo helicity suppression.
As soon as the neutrino mass deviates from zero, the correspondence between chirality and helicity is lost %
and the neutrino can be produced with both polarisations.
The main consequence is that the production of heavy neutrinos from light flavour mixings (electron) appears to be enhanced with %
respect to heavy flavours (muon and tau).
The effect is particularly dramatic when the mass difference between parent meson and charged lepton widens, %
as it happens with the electron decay of $D_s$, the enhancement of which is around \np{e6} for neutrino masses near 1\,GeV.

\end{figure}

%\clearpage
The scale factor $\mathcal{K}_h$ for leptonic decays of a pseudoscalar meson $P$ into neutrinos with helicity $h$, 
is given by the analytic expression
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{K}_\pm^{P, \alpha}(m_N) = |U_{\alpha N}|^2 & %
	\ \frac{\kallen(1,\ \xi_N^2,\ \xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2)}{2 \xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2(1-\xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2)^2} \notag \\
	\label{eq:shrock_helix}
	&\times \qty[\xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2+\xi_N^2-(\xi_N^2-\xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2)^2 %
		\pm(\xi_N^2-\xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2) \kallen(1,\ \xi_N^2,\ \xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2) ] \ , 
\end{align}
where $\lambda$ is the K\"all\'en function
\begin{equation}
	\lambda(a, b, c) = (a-b-c)^2-4\,b\,c\ ,
\end{equation}
and $\xi_i = \flatfrac{m_i}{m_X}$ is the mass ratio of the final-state particle $i$ over the parent particle mass.
When summing over the helicity states, the resulting factor coincides with the one computed in~\refref{Shrock:1981wq},
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{K}^{P, \alpha}(m_N) = \sum_{h = \pm 1} \mathcal{K}_h^{P, \alpha}(m_N) = |U_{\alpha N}|^2 &\  %
	\frac{\kallen(1,\ \xi_N^2,\ \xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2)}{\xi_\alpha^2(1-\xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2)^2} % \notag \\
 		\qty[\xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2+\xi_N^2-(\xi_N^2-\xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2)^2]\ .
\end{align}
In order to understand the effect of~\refeq{eq:shrock_helix}, it is convenient to define the fraction of neutrinos produced with a certain helicity as
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:scale_ratio}
	\mathcal{S}^\pm = \frac{\mathcal{K}_\pm^{P, \alpha}}{\mathcal{K}_{+1}^{P, \alpha} + \mathcal{K}_{-1}^{P, \alpha}} = 
	\frac{1}{2} \left[ 1 \pm \frac{(\xi_N^2-\xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2)\ \kallen(1,\ \xi_N^2, %
			\ \xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2)}{\xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2+\xi_N^2-(\xi_N^2-\xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2)^2}\right].
\end{equation}
In the limit of a massless neutrino, i.e.\ $\xi_N \to 0$, the fractions are $\mathcal{S}_+ \to 0$ and $\mathcal{S}_- \to 1$, as expected: %
all neutrinos are produced with a negative helicity.
The opposite is true when the charged lepton is in the massless limit and the neutrinos are produced with a positive~helicity.
The behaviour of the ratio $\mathcal{S}^\pm$ is shown in \reffig{fig:helix}.

		{The scale factors separated by helicity components are shown.
		In two-body decays (left), the $h=-1$ components (dashed) for all channels %
		do not depend on the mass.
		The enhancement is driven by the $h=+1$ components (dotted), %

		In three-body decays (right), there are two different scale factors for purely leptonic decays, noted as $\ell_\alpha \to \ell_\beta$: %

		are comparable, and if the decay is mediated by $|U_{\alpha N}|^2$, %

		In both cases, the two parts sum up to the same quantity (solid).
		The kaon decays are also divided in $h=-1$ (dashed) and $h=+1$ (dotted) components; $\tau^+\to\nu\pi^+\pi^0$ is %
		studied only at the phase space~level.}
	\label{fig:scale}
\end{figure}

The only two-body decay of a lepton considered in this work is $\tau \to \nu_\tau \pi$, whose scale factor reads
\begin{align}
	\mathcal{K}_\pm^{\tau, \pi}(m_N) = |U_{\tau N}|^2 &\  %
	\frac{\kallen(1,\ \xi_N^2,\ \xi_\pi^2)}{2 (1-\xi_\pi^2)^2} \notag \\
		&\times \qty[(1-\xi_N^2)^2 + \xi_\pi^2(1+\xi_N^2) \mp %
		(1 - \xi_N^2) \kallen(1,\ \xi_N^2,\ \xi_\pi^2) ] \ .
\end{align}
The structure is similar to the scale factor for pseudoscalar meson two-body decays, given in~\refeq{eq:shrock_helix}, %
and analogous considerations as above can be deduced.
This is explained by crossing symmetries, as the matrix element of the process is the same.
In this case, however, the positive helicity component does not lead to any enhancement before %
the phase space cut-off.

The effect of the scale factors as a function of the neutrino mass can be appreciated on %
the left panel of \reffig{fig:scale}, %
where the enhancement of negative helicity terms is apparent.
The phase space is also correctly described and the $\mathcal{K}$ drops to zero %
as the neutrino mass approaches its parent mass.

\subsection{Three-body decays}
\label{sec:production_3body}

%For three-body decays, the analogous factor cannot be easily computed analytically.
%We evaluate these factors numerically, as described in App.~\ref{sec:appscaling}.
Scale factors for three-body decays are defined in the same way as two-body decay ones.
Because of the different number of degrees of freedom, the helicity of the outgoing neutrinos is not fixed by %
the spin of the parent particles.
Hence, these factors are not responsible for any enhancement in the decay rate, %
but they only quench the process as the neutrino mass upper limit is approached (see~\reftab{tab:branch}).
The scale factors have nonetheless distinct behaviours depending on the helicity state involved.
They are plotted as a function of the heavy neutrino mass on the right panel of \reffig{fig:scale}.

The decay of a charged lepton (antilepton) of flavour $\alpha$ to a charged lepton (antilepton) of flavour $\beta$ %
can be proportional to either $|U_{\alpha N}|^2$ or $|U_{\beta N}|^2$, producing a heavy Dirac neutrino (antineutrino) in the first case %
or an antineutrino (neutrino) in the second case.
If the neutrino is Majorana, the decay can occur via both mixing matrix elements because the lepton number can be violated.
Decays of muons and taus yield massive neutrinos with the following decay rate%\marcom{PB}{I fiddled. Do you agree this holds for Maj. and Dir.?}

Neutral and charged kaons produce neutrinos in three-body semileptonic decays.
Both of them can decay into either a muon or an electron %
and a charged pion if the decaying kaon is neutral or a neutral pion if the kaon is charged.
The decay width of a pseudoscalar meson $h_1$ to a lighter meson $h_2$ is given by
\begin{equation}
	\Gamma_\pm (h_1^{+,0} \to h_2^{0,+}\,\ell_\alpha^+ N) = \frac{G_F^2 m_h^5}{128 \pi^3} |U_{\alpha N}|^2 |V_{q\cj{q}}|^2\ %
	I^\pm_{h_1} \qty(\xi_{h_2}^2, \xi_{\ell_\alpha}^2, \xi_N^2)\ .
\end{equation}
The integral $I_h(x, y, z)$ is
\begin{align}
	I^\pm_h(x, y, z) = \int\limits_{\qty(\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{y})^2}^{\qty(1-\sqrt{z})^2}\!\!
	%I^\pm_h(x, y, z) = \int\limits_{(x+y)^2}^{(1-z)^2}\!\!

	\text{with}\quad t_\pm = x + z + \frac{ (1-s-z)(s - y + x) \pm \kallen(s, y, z)\kallen(1, s, z) }{2 s}\ ,
\end{align}
where $F$ and $G$ are convenient combinations of hadronic form factors $f^{(h,h')}$.
From lattice QCD considerations, form factors should carry the correct Clebsch-Gordan, %
but here it is safe to drop them as they are irrelevant when studying scale factors.
The combinations $F$ and $G$ are
\begin{align}
	F &= 2\ f_+^{(h,h')}(u) = f_+^{(h,h')}(0)%
	\qty(1 + \lambda^{(h,h')}_+ \frac{u}{x})\ , \\
	G &= f_+^{(h,h')}(u) - f_-^{(h,h')}(u) \notag \\
	 &= f_+^{(h,h')}(0)%
	\qty[1 + \lambda^{(h,h')}_+ \frac{u}{x} - %
	\qty(\lambda^{(h,h')}_+ - \lambda^{(h,h')}_0) \qty( 1 + \frac{1}{x})]\ ,
\end{align}
with $\lambda$ parameterising the linear dependence~\cite{Tanabashi:2018oca} of the form factors %
with respect to the momentum transfer between the two mesons, $u$, %
directly connected to the other Mandelstam variables, $s$ and $t$:
\begin{equation}
	u = 1 + x + y + z - s - t\ .
\end{equation}
The values of $\lambda_{+,0}$ are determined experimentally~\cite{Tanabashi:2018oca}.
The functions $A$, $B$, and $C$ are
\begin{align}
	A^\pm(s, t) &= \frac{1}{2}(1 + y - t) \qty[ 1 + z - s \mp \kallen(1, z, s) ] - %
	\frac{1}{2}\qty[u - y - z \mp \kallen(u, y, z)]\ , \\
	B^\pm(s, t) &= \frac{1}{2}(y + z) (u - y - z) + 2 y z \mp (y - z) \frac{\kallen(u, y, z)}{2}\ , \\
	C^\pm(s, t) &= z (1 + y - t) + \qty[y \pm \frac{\kallen(u, y, z)}{2}] (1 + z - s)\ . 
\end{align}
When summing over helicity states, the kinematic functions simplify to
\begin{align}
	A(s, t) &= (1 + y - t)( 1 + z - s) - (u - y - z)\ , \\
	B(s, t) &= (y + z) (u - y - z) + 4\, y\, z\ , \\
	C(s, t) &= 2\, z\, (1 + y - t) + 2\, y\, (1 + z - s)\ .
\end{align}
The scale factor was checked numerically against the result of~\refref{Abada:2013aba}.
%From lattice QCD considerations, the decay width is halved when the decay is into $\pi^0$, %
%even though this is irrelevant for the scale factor.

The final three-body decay studied in this work is $\tau^+ \to \cj{\nu}_\tau \pi^+ \pi^0$, %
even though this channel is introduced only at the phase space level.
The scale factors for the two helicity components are therefore assumed to be identical, %
$\mathcal{K}_\pm = \flatfrac{1}{2}$, such that the neutrino flux subcomponent coming from this decay %
consists of equal number of heavy neutrinos with helicity $h=+1$ and $h=-1$.


\section*{\em Summary}

The origin of the light neutrino masses are elegantly described by low-scale seesaw models %
which can additionally predict new phenomenologically viable physics scales, accessible by next generation experiments.
In this chapter, the inverse seesaw manifestation of the neutrino mass matrix %
has been investigated in an extended SM scenario.
Depending on the precise realisation, Majorana or (pseudo-)Dirac heavy neutral leptons are allowed %
to decay into SM visible particles.
Such heavy neutrinos can be produced in the beam with light neutrinos at neutrino beam facilities %
and for this reason the region of interest spans from tens of MeV up to a few GeV.
Formulae to compute production and decay rates have been computed using spinor-helicity formalism %
so as to pay particular attention to the HNL helicity.
It is found that not only Dirac and Majorana neutrinos have different total decay rates in neutral current processes, %
but also that their decay distributions have a different dependency on the helicity.
An effective evaluation of the heavy neutrino flux, %
in which the HNL mass plays an important role, has also been carried out.
Certain production modes are not helicity-suppressed anymore and so they appear enhanced %
with respect to the same production channels for light neutrinos.
The two helicity components of the neutrino flux therefore behave differently %
and their correct descriptions are necessary for a precise prediction of HNL decay events.
