\chapter{Gadolinium-loaded water Cherenkov detector}

Being electrically neutral and uncoloured particles, neutrinos can only interact through weak interactions.
For this reason, coupled with the small cross-sections typical of the weak force, the study of neutrino results %
in a challenging task.
Direct observation is unfeasible, thus detection must rely on weak interactions with matter, where %
their SU(2) charged counterparts are either produced or scattered, by CC or NC interactions respectively.
The physics is mediated by the lagrangians in Eq.~\ref{eq:cc} and~\ref{eq:nc}.

Large active volumes have to be employed, such that a significant number of neutrino can be considered and %
interaction probability is thus increased.
These apparatus are often built underground to shield the detector from cosmic rays and other barckground radiation.
Apart from providing matter to interact with, at the same time these volumes must be capable of detecting %
the scattered charged leptons.
Many are the materials or substances that can be used, like chlorine, gallium, solid or liquid scintillators.

One of the most promising techniques is to combine liquid argon with time projection chambers.
As with most other liquefied noble gases, argon has a high scintillation light yield %
(ca 51~photons/keV[arXiv:1004.0373]), is transparent to its own scintillation light, and is relatively easy to purify.
Compared to xenon, argon is also cheaper and has a distinct scintillation time profile which allows the separation %
of electronic recoils from nuclear recoils.

A more dated and better-known technology is the \emph{water Cherenkov} method, where the detector is used to %
record the Cherenkov light produced when the particles pass through pass through tanks full of purified water. 

\section{Water cherenkov}
\label{sec:wch}

The speed of light in vacuum is a universal constant, $c$, and it is a physical limit of the propagation %
of information, as stated by the special theory of Relativity.
However, when in a medium, light may travel at speed significantly less than $c$.
This reduction of speed depends on the relative permittivity, $\varepsilon$, of the material in which light is %
propagating.
Because of the non-zero real part of the dielectric constant, the electromagnetic (EM) field is modified and %
the phase velocity of light changes into
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:light}
	v_P = \frac{c}{\sqrt{\varepsilon(\lambda)}} = \frac{c}{n(\lambda)}\,,
\end{equation}
where $n(\lambda) > 1$ is the \emph{refractive index} of the medium and %
depends on the wavelenght (energy) of the wave.

A charged particles moving at a constant velocity in a dielectric medium disrupts the local electromagnetic field, %
by deforming its molecules and temporarily polarising the material.
The dipoles are restored almost instantaneously and thus become impulsive sources of EM waves.
If the velocity of the passing particle, $v = \beta c$, is less than the speed of the light in the medium %
as expressed in Eq.~\ref{eq:light}, i.e.\ $\beta < 1/n$, then the total energy flux of the excited %
field is zero and EM waves are not irradiated.
On the contrary, if $\beta > 1/n$, the perturbance left by the passage of the particle is such that %
the energy is released coherently.
The result is that the field is different from zero in a cone coaxial with respect to the direction of %
the charged particle, whose direction is opposite to the particle motion.
As far as the photons are concerned, these are emitted coherently to a fixed angle with respect %
to the particle motion.
With the help of Fig.~\ref{fig:cherenkov}, it is easy to find that:
\begin{align}
	\sin \alpha &= \frac{1}{\beta n}\,\\
	\cos \theta &= \frac{1}{\beta n}\,.
\end{align}
where $\alpha$ is the apex angle of the cone and $\theta$ is the photon angle with respect to the particle direction.
For an ultra-relativistic particle, for which $\beta \sim 1$, there is a maximum angle of emission, given by:
\begin{equation}
	\cos \theta_{\mathrm{MAX}} = \frac{1}{n}\,.
\end{equation}

The phenomenon is called \emph{Cherenkov effect}, and it occurs everytime a charged particle passes through a %
dielectric medium at a speed:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:cherenkov}
	\beta > \frac{1}{n}\,.
\end{equation}
According to the theory of electromagnetic waves, a charged particle moving uniformly does not irradiate %
and this proves that the Cherenkov radiation is not related with Bremsstrahlung. 

This condition can be expressed in terms of the particle energy, given that $E^2 = p^2+m^2$ and %
$\beta = p/E$\footnote{For this calculation, the convention $c = 1$ is adopted.}.
The threshold becomes:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:ch_Eth}
	\frac{E}{m} > \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-1/n^2}}\,,
\end{equation}
with $m$ the mass of the charged particle.

The radiation is emitted in the visible and near visible regions of the EM spectrum, for which $ n > 1$.
A real medium is always dispersive and radiation is restricted to those frequencies bands for which %
$n(\nu) > \frac{1}{\beta}$.
In the x-ray region, for instance, $n(\nu)$ is always less than one and radiation is forbidden at this energies, %
because Eq.~\ref{eq:cherenkov} cannot be satisfied.

Truly, coherent emission of light needs two more conditions to be fulfilled:
\begin{itemize}
	\item the length of the track of the particle in the medium should be large compared with the wavelength, %
		$\lambda$, of the radiation in question, otherwise diffraction effects will become dominant;
	\item the velocity of the particle must be constant during its passage through the medium, or, %
		to be more specific, the differences in the times for particle to traverse successive $\lambda$ distances %
		should be small compared with the period $\frac{\lambda}{c}$ of the emitted light.
\end{itemize}

The number of photons emitted by a charged particle of charge $Ze$ per unit path length and per unit %
energy interval, or equivalently to $\lambda$, of the photons is equal to:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:ch_ph}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}^2N}{\mathrm{d}x\mathrm{d}\lambda} = \frac{2\pi\alpha Z^2}{\lambda^2} %
	\bigg(1-\frac{1}{\beta^2 n^2(\lambda)} \bigg)\,.
\end{equation}
This means that the greater part of Cherenkov photons are emitted in the ultraviolet range, because of the %
proportionality to $1/\lambda^2$.

\emph{Cherenkov detectors} take advantage of this effect, detecting the light produced by charge particles.
A large volume of transparent material, such as water, ice, or liquid scintillator, can be %
surrounded by lightsensitive detectors in order to capture the Cherenkov radiation.
This technique is largely used in neutrino detection, since they cannot be detected directly: the charged lepton, %
yeilded in CC or NC interactions, is observed.
From the light collected, it is possibile to reconstruct information on the interaction, such as the velocity %
of the charged particle, which is somehow related to the energy of the incident neutrino, or the position %
of the interaction vertex.
If the charged lepton drop under the Cherenkov threshold, the light is emitted in the shape of a ring, which %
further data can be inferred from.
Not every neutrino energy allows the production of a charged lepton\footnote{For instance, the CCQE process %
	$\bar\nu_e+p\rightarrow n+e^+$ has a energy threshold of \np{1.81}~MeV and the interaction %
	$\nu_\mu+n\rightarrow p+\mu^-$ has the threshold of \np{110.16}~MeV, because of the muon mass.}, %
but only MeV-scale neutrinos can be observed in a Cherenkov detector.


\section{The gadolinium phase of Super-Kamiokande}

In the next phase of the Super-Kamiokande experiment, a gadolinium salt compound Gd\tped{2}(SO\tped{4})\tped{3} %
will be added to the detector~\cite{}, which will improve the ability of the detector to identify neutrons.
Neutrons are emitted in inverse beta decay (IBD) process, $\cj{\nu}_e + p \to e^+ + n$.
The current technique to tag neutrons in SK is by detecting capture on hydrogen nuclei.
Capture of a thermal neutron on hydrogen has a cross section of $\np{332.6}\pm\np{0.7}$~\,b, %
characteristic time of $\sim200$\,\textmu s in water, with the release of $\np{2.2}$\,MeV gammas.
After the prompt Cherenkov radiation from the charged lepton, the secondary signal from an electron, %
compton-scattered by the 2.2\,MeV photon, is looked for in a long time window.
However, in water what matters are the electrons Compton-scattered above the Cerenkov threshold by relatively hard gammas.
The detectable light following neutron capture on Gd (in thin foils) in possible discrete counters was carefully simulated %
for the SNO heavy water Cerenkov detector.
The equivalent single electron energy was found to peak at about 5 MeV, and range over 3--8\,MeV.
This spread reflects the intrinsic variation in the gamma cascades and the detector energy
resolution (the simulation had 5 photoelectrons per MeV of electron energy, compared to 6 in SK-I)~\cite{hep-ph/0309300}.
The energy threshold for SK is 5\,MeV, and the search of hydrogen-tagged neutrons is not efficient (20\%).
a long time window in which to look for the hydrogen signal, 
Capture on gadolinium has a cross section of $\np{49e3}$~b, which de-excites emitting a $\sim\np{8}$~MeV gamma-ray cascade.
By adding 0.2\,\% by mass of the Gd salt as Gd\tped{2}(SO\tped{4})\tped{3}, the characteristic time of capture is %
$\sim30$~\textmu s and an efficiency of 90\,\% can be achieved.
The isotopes \tapi{155}Gd and \tapi{157}Gd present very high cross-sections to thermal neutron capture, %
respectively \np{6.074e4}\,b and \np{2.537e5}\,b.
Hydrogen alone has a cross section of \np{3.321e-1}\,b.

One of the main motivation to detect neutrons is to be able to detect relic supernova neutrinos, %
also know as Diffuse Supernova Neutrino Background (DSNB), produced from all previous core-collapse supernova expolosions in the Universe.
This measurement will provide very important information on, for example, the mean energy spectrum %
of core collapse supernovae and the star formation rate of the universe.
This measurement is largely affected by irreducible backgrounds, like invisible muon decay at low energies---%
muons below Cherenkov threshold that decay into electrons---and at high energies by atmospheric neutrinos.
The lower energy threshold is defined by our ability to remove spallation events and solar neutrinos, %
that can be excluded effectively with neutron tagging.
The energy of these neutrinos should be around a few tens of MeV.
The largest cross section in this search corresponds to IBD, %
which is two orders of magnitude larger than $\nu_e$ elastic scattering.
The predictions provide with several limits but although SK has the best world limit, %
DSNB has not been detected yet.
However, if we could detect neutrons efficiently, these backgrounds could be reduced significantly and thus, %
making the detection of the DSNB possible for the first time.

Another motivation is searches of galactic supernova burst.
When a massive star at the end of its life collapses to a neutron star, %
it radiates almost all of its binding energy in the form of neutrinos, %
most of which have energies in the range 10 to 30\,MeV, and are emitted over a timescale of several tens of seconds.
These neutrinos are released just after core collapse, whereas the photon signal may take hours %
or days to emerge from the stellar envelope.
SK will acquire a huge number of neutrino events if the supernova is inside out galaxy, %
providing much information about early stages of the core-collapse process, %
its spectrum and time profile.
Start that are at the onset of their collapse, just after carbon ignition, will release most of its energy through neutrinos.
During the silicon burning stage, the neutrino luminosity is eight orders of magnitude less than %
in the peak at core-collapse, but while the later lasts just a few seconds, %
the Si burning phase takes several days.
During the Si burning phase roughly 1\,\% of the total energy of core-collapse are emitted through
``pre-supernova'' neutrinos with a monotonically increasing rate.

Improved neutron tagging will also be helpful to understand atmospheric and accelerator neutrino interactions and final states.
Also the separation of neutrino and antineutrino at the GeV scale will benefit from neutron tagging.
Finally, the background in proton decay searches can be reduced, since it requires no neutrons to appear in the final state.

\section{Gadolinium neutron capture}
\label{sec:gdcap}

Current multi-kiloton scale water Cherenkov detectors, like Super-Kamiokande (SK), have provided %
many clues in the experimental understanding of the neutrino, be it originated in solar, atmospheric, or %
accelerator reactions.
However, in spite of the large lifetime of the experiment, some analyses are still limited by statistical uncertainty, %
and would benefit from increasing exposure.
Other analyses suffer from background contamination, as in the case of the supernova relic neutrinos (SRN) search, %
and would benefit more from the development of new background suppression techniques.
This hindrance can be overcome by studying the yield of neutrons in neutrino interactions, such as the %
\emph{inverse beta decay} (the antineutrino CCQE scattering).
It would allow a handle on antineutrinos rate, and possibly a method of background reduction for other studies.

Since neutrons are chargeless, they cannot interact with matter by means of the Coulomb force, %
which dominates the energy loss mechanisms for charged particles, described by the Bethe formula.
Neutrons can interact with nuclei in various way, depending on the energy:
\begin{itemize}
	\item elastic and inelastic scattering;
	\item transmutation;
	\item neutron activation;
	\item spallation reaction;
	\item neutron-induced fission;
\end{itemize}

As a result of the interaction, the neutron may either be absorbed, or change its energy and direction significantly.
In this way the average energy of a neutron beam can be completely or partly reduced up to thermal energies, %
close to \np{0.025}~eV.
In this range of energy, the neutron presents a different and often much larger effective neutron absorption %
cross-section for a given nuclide, compared to, for instance, fast neutrons, hence \emph{thermalisation} can %
result in a \emph{neutron activation} process.
This occurs when atomic nuclei capture free thermal neutrons, creating heavier nuclei, often in an excited state.
The excited nucles decays almost instantaneously emitting usually gamma rays.

The neutron energy distribution is adopted to the Maxwellian distribution known for thermal motion.
The time required by the thermalisation of neutrons follows an exponential, and the time constant is largely %
studied, [ref needed], amongst all the thermalisation in water.
It was found that neutron thermalisation in water has a time constant of 5$\mu$s [fujino, sumita, shiba].
Neutrons can be captured by either the hydrogen or the oxygen.
Free neutron will capture on a hydrogen nucleus, releasing a 2.2 MeV gamma.
In SK, for instance, this gamma results in about seven photo-electrons, and thus only detectable with $\simeq$20\,\% %
efficiency.

Gadolinium-157 has the highest thermal neutron capture cross-section among any stable %
nuclides: 259,000 barns.
Dissolving gadolinium compounds in water could considerably increase the neutron capture probability.
The neutron in water thermalises quickly and can thus be captured by a Gd nucleus with a probability of 90\,\%.
Upon capturing a neutron the Gd emits 3-4 gamma rays having a total energy of about 8 MeV.
The time and spatial correlation of the positron and neutron capture events ($20~\mu$s and 4~cm) %
can significantly reduce the backgrounds, and hence enhance the nu e signal events.
Even moderately energetic neutrons ranging from tens to hundreds of MeV will quickly lose energy %
by collisions with free protons and oxygen nuclei in water. 
Once thermalised, the neutrons undergo radiative capture, combining with a nearby nucleus to %
produce a more tightly bound final state, with excess energy released in a gamma-ray ( ) cascade. 
Gd-doped water enhances the capture cross-section compared to pure water %
(49,000 barns compared with 0.3 barns on a free proton) and, since the cascade happens %
at higher energies (8 MeV vs 2.2 MeV), it produces enough optical light to be reliably detected in %
a large target volume.

\section{Gadolinium sulfate}

In the original proposal by John Beacom and Mark Vagins, gadolinium trichloride GdCl\tped{3} was proposed, %
but the current full-scal plan has steered on gadolinium sulfate Gd\tped{2}(SO\tped{4})\tped{3} %
as the salt of choice (other candidate could be gadolinium nitrate Gd(NO\tped{3})\tped{3}).
There are a few requirements which a Gd compound must meet in order to become a good candidate for a full scale test.
The compound must be water soluble, and it should not be too difficult to dissolve large amounts.
The above three candidates can all be dissolved fairly easily, with the GdCl3 and Gd(NO3)3 only
needing stirring to fully dissolve, while the Gd2(SO4)3, can be forced into solution with the addition of %
a small amount of sulfuric acid, about 380 ml of acid for 28 kg of Gd2(SO4)3 in 14 tons of water (test done at EGADS).
So, this solubility requirement does not immediately rule out any of these three compounds.
Next, if the compound is to be used inside a very large water Cherenkov detector, such as SK, it must be safe for
the detectors components and tank, and it should be a non-toxic chemical, so it may be easily put into existing detectors.
While none of the above salts are toxic, they do have very different corrosive properties, due to the different anions of the molecule.
The nitrate and the sulfate turn out to be non-corrosive, and do not seem to affect detectors components much, if at all.
An extensive soak test study was carried out in Japan, with each of the 31 different materials inside the SK detector %
being soaked in both pure water and Gd2(SO4)3 solution.
Only the rubber used for the PMT pressure housing showed any difference between the pure water and the Gd2(SO4)3 solution, %
with further studies showing the rubber is unaffected by the Gd solution, if the temperature is kept below 15\,${}^\circ$C, %
which it is in the case of SK.
However, the chloride is corrosive, so for this reason the GdCl3 has been ruled out as a full scale test candidate.
Last the Gd compound solution must maintain a high level of optical transparency, %
so that light can be seen from the opposite side of the detector.
Although the GdCl3 has fairly good optical properties, it has been ruled out by the above.
Gd(NO3)3 is opaque in the UV region of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, for wavelengths less than 350\,nm, %
and this unfortunately is where a large fraction of Cherenkov light is detected in SK PMTs, %
so it cannot be a good full scale test candidate either.
This leaves Gd2(SO4)3, and it turns out to have good transparency in the UV and optical regions of the EM spectrum, %
leaving it as the best candidate for the EGADS test facility.
This is in fact the choice that has been made by the EGADS group, and the remaining studies described in this paper %
have been done using, or under the assumption that, Gd2(SO4)3 will be used.
One last exceptionally nice quality about this compound is today it costs only 5 US dollars per kilogram, %
meaning it would only be about 500,000 US dollars to dope SK [11], a price which is on the scale of such a major experiment.~\cite{1201.1017}.

\section{Gadolinium purity}

\section{Gadolinium concentration}

The concentration of Gd in water affects the efficiency and timing of neutron captures, antineutrino measurements depends on this.
It is fundamental to measure the concentration regularly, as this can change in time inside the tank.
On such a large scale, it is not a trivial task to predict temperature and flow dependency of the dissolved Gd.
At the moment, the Evaluating Gadolinium's Action on Detector Systems (EGADS) keeps track of the Gd concentration
with a Zeeman atomic absorption spectrometer, located near the experiment.
Water samples are collected from the EGADS tank, diluted and atomised inside the AAS machine.
The amount of Gd is then compared to known samples of Gd loaded water to determine the concentration.

We propose an alternative method, which still uses atomic absorption lines of Gd, but in solution in water.
Gadolinium presents strong emission/absorption lines in the UV region~\cite{NIST}.
Using a UV source and a spectrometer it would be possible to measure the absorption by gadolinium dissolved in water.
The absorbance in directly proportional to the amount of gadolinium and therefore to the concentration, %
where absorbance is defined as
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{A}(x) = \log_{10} \frac{I_0 (x)}{I_\text{Gd}(x)}\ .
\end{equation}
The spectrum $I_0$ of a reference sample of pure water is taken before the gadolinium loaded water sample $I_\text{Gd}$.
These two spectrum are then compared at a given wavelength.
The gadolinium absorbance spectrum presents a series of lines in the 270\,nm -- 275\,nm region.
The height of one peak is related to the concentration, as the amount of light surviving the sample is related to
\begin{equation}
	I_\text{Gd}(x) = I_0(x) e^{-\flatfrac{\ell}{\lambda}}\ ,
\end{equation}
with $\lambda$ the attenuantion length and $\ell$ the sample length.
For a fixed cross-section volume and a fixed-length sample, the attenuation length will %
decrease with the amount of Gd in the sample $m_\text{Gd}$, or since the volume is constant, with the concentration of Gd $\rho_\text{Gd}$.
\begin{equation}
	\rho_\text{Gd} = \frac{m_\text{Gd}}{X\,\ell}\ .
\end{equation}
The Beer-Lambert law relates the optical attenuation of a physical material containing a single attenuating species %
of uniform concentration to the optical path length through the sample and absorptivity of the species.
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{A} = \varepsilon\, \ell\, \rho = \log_{10} (e) \frac{\ell}{\lambda}\ ,
\end{equation}
where $\varepsilon$ is the molar attenuation coefficient, or absorptivity, of the attenuating species.
The Beer-Lambert law agrees with the expectation of decreasing attenuation length with increasing concentration.

In an absorbance measurement, however, there could be other sources of absorption.
In a real setup, a light source and a photo sensor are needed, in addition to optical interfaces with the %
sample to measure; the solvent of the sample will also contribute to the overall absorbance.
The Beer-Lamber law can be generalised to a generic $N$ number of attenuating elements
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{A} = \sum_{i = 1}^N \varepsilon_i \int_0^\ell \dd{z} \rho_i (x) = %
	\varepsilon \ell \rho_0 +  \sum_{i = 1}^{N-1} \varepsilon_i \int_0^\ell \dd{z} \rho_i (x) = a + b \, \rho_0\ ,
\end{equation}
where the attenuating species of interest has been isolated: %
if the other elements are constant, there is a linear law with measured absorbance and concentration.
The absorbance will also depend on the solvent, \ie water, purity and other factors, \eg optical interfaces etc.
The measurement of absorption could also be biased by the presence of wavelength-independent factors, %
or at least independent in the portion of the spectrum of interest.
Examples of these factors could are micro-bubbles or other impurities in the samples.
Micro-bubbles will scatter or block light, thus adding a bias on teh absorbance measurement.
Using two absorption peaks the measurement could be improved by taking the difference of the absorption, %
as any effect which is wavelength independent is removed.
\begin{equation}
	\Delta \mathcal{A} = \mathcal{A}(x_1) - \mathcal{A}(x_2) = %
	\log_{10} \frac{I_0 (x_1)}{I(x_1)} - \log_{10} \frac{I_0 (x_2)}{I(x_2)}\ .
\end{equation}
Supposing the intensity of the reference sample is reduced by a factor $\eta$, %
whereas the intensity of the study sample is reduced by a factor $\zeta$, we would have
\begin{equation}
	\Delta \mathcal{A} = %
	\log_{10} \frac{\eta I_0 (x_1)}{\zeta I(x_1)} - \log_{10} \frac{\eta I_0 (x_2)}{\zeta I(x_2)} = %
	\log_{10} \frac{I_0 (x_1)}{I(x_1)} - \log_{10} \frac{I_0 (x_2)}{I(x_2)}\ ,
\end{equation}
since the difference of two logarithmic elements is taken.
The drawback of this method is that two measurements are needed at the two wavelengths $x_1$ and $x_2$, %
and therefore the error on the measurement will increase by a factor $\sim \sqrt{2}$.

\section{Gadolinium Absorbance Detector}

The first concept of tracking gadolinium concentration in water using absorbance spectrum %
was tested using a 1\,cm cell in a commercial spectrophotometer Shimadzu UV2600, %
in which an initial sample of 0.2\,\% Gd water is diluited to obtain different concentration levels.
The gadolinium loaded sample is compared to a pure water one to compute the absorbance spectrum.
The result is...? And linear fit.
The Shimadzu spectrophotometer uses a grating system to select very narrow windows of electromagnetic spectrum %
both at the source and at the detection, which is done by a photomultiplier.
The source at UV wavelengths is provided by a deuterium lamp, integrated in the spectrometer.
The advantage of this technique is that very high resolution can be achieved, %
but a scan wavelength per wavelength is done, taking one measurement at the time.
This process can be quite slow and the gain from the resolution is not so relevant.
We tested different model of other commercial spectrometers, without integrated source and %
with a grating system such that the input light is spread out on a linear CCD.
Doing so, the whole spectrum to which the spectroemter is sensitive to, is taken simultaneously.
The measurement is then only limited to the reading speed rate of the spectrometer.
A set of consecutive measurement can be taken and averaging them the error can also be estimated.
After testing different models from different companies, we purchased an Ocean HDX spectrometer.
The advantage of this spectrometer is a very high light throughput thanks to a toroidal mirroring system %
which reduces stray light and maximises the input light.
In addition to this, the sensor has a high dynamic range, which is the determing factor %
on the absorbance measurement.
Wavelength resolution is not as important, because we use the relative position of the gadolinium peaks %
to determine the absorbance.



The first prototype based on a 10 cm cell for 0.2$\%$ Gadolinium sulphate doping achieved %
a $3\%$ concentration measurement resolution ($1\%$ neutron capture efficiency) %
at the target concentration in comparison to the $3.5\%$ currently achieved via a manual mass spectrometer method.

This device was intended for deployment in EGADS in Japan but the Gadolinium sulphate %
concentration was changed to $0.02\%$ in preparation for Super-K phase 1 loading.
Therefore work progressed to building the version 2 prototype of GAD for %
sensitivity to $0.02\%$, by increasing the volume to $\approx 1$ meter.

This prototype has been successfully built and tested and shown a concentration measurement %
resolution of $1\%$ at both $0.02\%$ and $0.2\%$ doping.

To measure neutron tagging efficiency, an americium-beryllium (Am-Be) source is placed inside
a bismuth germanite (BGO) crystal scintillator and the whole device is usually deployed %
at the centre of the water Cherenkov detector.
The americium-241 goes through $\alpha$ decay with a half-life of 432.6\,y. [100\% ?]
The $\alpha$ particle is captured by the \tapi{9}Be nuclei to become \tapi{12}C\tapi{*} with the emission of a neutron.
The carbon de-excites to the ground state with sometimes the emission of a 4.43\,MeV photon.
The gamma ray is promptly captured by the BGO crystal, and the scintillation light triggers the detector.
The neutron thermalises in the water with an average time of roughly 200\,\textmu s, %
before begin captured on a hydrogen nucleus with the release of a 2.2\,MeV photon.
Neutron tagging efficiency on hydrogen in SK was measured to be $(19.0\pm0.2)$\,\%, %
using a unbinned maximum likelihood fitting~\cite{}.
Neutrons released by beryllium have an energy ranging from 2-10 MeV, %
much less than the average neutron energy following atmospheric neutrino interactions.
Thus, we can make the assumption that the location of the Am-Be apparatus is roughly the same %
as the neutron capture vertex.


Another possible source for neutron calibration is californium-252, which %
undergoes $\alpha$-emissions (96.91\%) and spontaneous fission (SF) (3.09\%).
With a half-life of 2.645\,y, a \tapi{252}Cf source has a higher activity compared to an Am-Be source %
with the same number of nucleons.
Furthermore, the SF process emits an average of 3.75 neutrons per fission and an average of 10.3 photons %
having a total energy of 8.2\,Mev.
As for the case of Am-Be, the photons can be collected by a scintillating material to tag the %
emission of neutrons.
After this trigger signal, multiple neutron captures on hydrogen are expected, %
separated by short intervals in time.
The yield of multiple neutrons is another advantage of \tapi{252}Cf that %
the SNO collaboration exploited to develop a method, called \emph{Time Series Analysis} method that uses %
multiplicity and time intervals between the detected events %
to find the neutron detection efficiency, the neutron mean life inside the detector, %
and activity from non-fission events.
The fast-neutron and photon energy spectra are shown in \ref{fig:spectra}: %
the neutrons are emitted with a most-probable energy of 0.7\,MeV and an average energy of 2.1\,MeV.

A \tapi{252}Cf source was purchased by QMUL with an activity of 4.3\,kBq, measured on the 28\tapi{th} of July, 2017.
The californium is encapsulated in a double hull stainless steel cylinder, 9.5\,mm in diameter and 37.5\,mm high.
The source is tested in a simple calibration device (see Fig.~\ref{fig:setup}), which consists of a cylindrical plastic scintillator %
(EJ-200), coated with mylar to contain optical photons, and optically coupled to a ET Enterprise 9902B series~PMT.
A hole, coaxial to the plastic cylinder, allows to place the source in the middle of the scintillator.
The cylinder is 3\,in in length and 1.5\,in in diameter.
With this setup, the rate of photons emitted by the \tapi{252}Cf source can be measured; %
we used a Struck SIS3316 14-bit VME digitiser to count the number of photon triggers from the PMT and %
a daisy-chain of NIM amplifier, threshold, and discriminator is used before the digitiser to optimise the signal.
Without the source inside the scintillator, an event rate of 1.633\,Hz was measured, whereas with the source inside %
the rate increases to 41.395\,Hz.
The distributions of the PMT peaks collected by the digitiser are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:source}.
A predicted activity of 3.1\,kBq is expected on the day when the measurement was %
taken---446 days after the activity measurement---which translates to a SF rate of 96.46\,Hz.
The SF tagging efficiency with this setup is therefore around~41\,\%.

\end{figure}

We performed a GEANT4 simulation of the setup, with the aim of optimising the calibration device.
An ideal calibration device would absorb all the photons converting them into visible light without affect the neutrons.
The plot in Fig.~\ref{fig:QE} shows the correct implementation of the scintillator and PMT efficiencies, %
as there is good agreement with the MC distribution and the expected optical photon spectrum.
The scintillating volume is therefore varied in the simulation to study the preformance of the decive.
Bismuth germanate oxide (BGO) crystal and a generic vinyltouluene plastic are studied as scintillating materials.
The size of the scintillator is also varied and shapes of a cube and a cylinder with equal diameter and height are tested.
The simulation keeps track of the energy deposited in the scintillator and the number of neutrons escaping the device.
The result is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:geant4}.
Unsurprisingly, the BGO crystal performs better than the plastic scintillator, %
with the optimal volume being a cube with 12\,cm sides.
The hydrogen in the plastic thermalises neutrons, which can have an impact on the thermalisation time %
in a water Cherenkov detector.

%To verify neutron tagging efficiency given above, experimental tests were conducted with an Am/Be source embedded in a bismuth germanite (BGO) scintillator. The prompt and delayed event-pair is generated via: α + 9Be →12
%C∗+n; 12C∗ →12 C+γ(prompt); n+p → d+γ(delayed).
%The scintillation light induced by 4.43 MeV deexcitation γ
%serves as the primary event. Note that the reaction to the
%ground state of 12C also exists, where no 4.43 MeV deexcitation γ is emitted. The experimental apparatus was
%deployed at the center of the tank, during which the trigger
%gate to catch 2.2 MeV γ was temporarily enlarged to 800
%μs in order to obtain a complete neutron capture time spectrum. To estimate source related background (e.g. ground
%transition neutron), 10 Hz 800μs random trigger data was
%also taken.
%The final N10 distribution after all cuts applied is shown in
%Fig. 2, where for Am/Be data all backgrounds are subtracted according to random trigger data. Signal efficiencies for
%MC and data are (19.2±0.1)% and (19.0±0.2)%, respectively. Data is in good agreement with MC. Fig. 3 shows
%the distribution of time difference (ΔT) between delayed
%neutron signal and prompt event. The neutron lifetime in
%pure water is measured to be (201.8 ± 4.7)μs using a unbinned maximum likelihood fitting as shown in Fig. 3.
%
%The Am-Be source is embedded in a 5 cm cube of BGO scintillator (see figure 8.27)
%to amplify the light released by the 4.4 MeV γ-ray, such that it will activate the SHE
%trigger in the detector. Upon triggering SHE stores 35µs of data, and then an extended
%AFT trigger is activated to store an additional 800µs, and grant a more complete view
%the neutron capture time spectrum.
%Figure 8.27: Am-Be crystal embedded in a 5 cm cube of BGO scintillator. This is
%held in an acrylic case.
%This configuration was set up in 3 different locations around the tank: the centre (35.3,
%-70.7, 0) cm (Centre), near the side of the barrel (35.3, -1201.9, 0) cm (Y12), and near
%the top of the tank (35.3, -70.7, 1500.0) cm (Z15). Random data was also taken with
%the apparatus in the centre, using a 10Hz trigger, to study the irreducible background
%from the ground-state transition.
%
%
%Neutron tagging is then performed on the remaining Am-Be dataset, and a 2.2 MeV
%γ-ray MC. There are some differences between this study and the atmospheric neutrino study discussed up until now. Neutrons released by Beryllium have an energy
%ranging from 2-10 MeV, much less than the average neutron energy following atmospheric neutrino interactions. Thus, we can make the assumption that the location of
%the Am-Be apparatus is roughly the same as the neutron capture vertex. This raises
%the expected neutron detection efficiency in accordance with figure 8.23. In addition,
%Chapter 8. Neutron Tagging 140
%the PMT after-pulse observed following high energy atmospheric neutrino events (figure 8.5) is not produced to the same extent after Am-Be events, so neutron searching
%is started at 5µs (previously > 18µs) after the primary trigger. The AFT trigger for
%Am-Be is also extended, allowing neutron-searching until 835µs after the initial trigger.
%The efficiency is calculated by fitting the timing distribution of neutron candidates to a
%constant background + exponentially decaying signal representing the neutron capture
%lifetime.
